0,J O'Reilly,Economy Class,Dubai to LHR,Business,September 2015,False,Paris - London - Nassau. All flights on time. Flight from Paris to London on A319 was a short trip and comfortable. The 2nd flight from London to Nassau on an old 767. Food was good and tasty with plenty of drinks on offer. Flight was not too crowded so plenty of room for people to spread about the cabin. Only issue with the flight was the AVOD which was very old so picture was not so clear and sound terrible. Other than that a good experience.
1,Thompson Alan,Economy Class,LHR to PEK,Business,August 2015,False,London Gatwick to Bari. Bag drop very slow and couldn't print luggage tag. Plane an old 737 but very well preserved clean and very tidy. Cabin crew very nice. As always the pilot explained the real reason for the one hour delay. Why do ground crew always say 'due to late arrival of incoming aircraft'? Sandwich lunch very nice and good drink selection. Once onboard a very good experience.
2,Scott Alan,Economy Class,Cape Town to London Heathrow,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,Went from Sydney to Singapore to London to Lisbon a long flight over 27 hours including 2 hours each at Sing and London. Have flown with the Asian carriers that were very good but flew BA this time as best value for Lisbon. I was not expecting great service but was pleasantly surprised the planes were good with good entertainment and food was good. The staff were also pleasant and professional. Only criticism was on all legs including return they did not ask people in front to raise seats when they served meals I asked in 2 cases and they asked person in front to raise seats but I saw many that did not ask and they did not get people to raise them. All other Asian airlines come along and say when they are serving meals to raise seats.
3,Livingston Alan,Premium Economy,London to New York JFK,Business,September 2015,True,I flew Glasgow-Gatwick-Vegas-Gatwick-Glasgow. I have flown this way before as I get to put my baggage on at Glasgow and forget about it. Glasgow-Gatwick no real comment other than cabin crew don't do much more than the minimum. Flew Premium Economy on a 777-200 flight was full. Premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from the Toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at the front again cabin crew do no more than the minimum food just about acceptable. Return flight of the same standard they kept trying to say I was booked back to Edinburgh took them an age to sort this out breakfast is a bit of a joke have found when flying BA that its best to carry snacks as they don't over feed you. Of course when I got back to Gatwick I ran into the French ATC control strike no announcement made. After having to hang around Gatwick all day I finally got a flight to Glasgow at 8pm at least my luggage arrived well done to BA there. When I made a comment to BA customer service I was told by them that my flight(s) had been cancelled due to Aircraft unserviceability when I queried this the respondent confirmed that aircraft u/s could offer no explanation as to why I was told different. I would like to complement BA but Virgin totally beat them hands down.
4,C Kay,First Class,Glasgow to New York via LHR,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,Bridgetown to London Gatwick on Avios companion ticket. Fantastic cabin crew - friendly yet professional - good and tasty choice of food and very nice selection of wines. After a few less than satisfactory BA experiences of late this one proved that they can deliver a top quality product.
5,Chris Willwtt,First Class,Heathrow to Johannesburg,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,LHR-YVR-LHR. Flew in in First on very shabby 744 which was nothing like First was displayed on the BBC documentary about BA. Squeezing so many passengers into the nose of a 744 is a joke. The staff both ways were excellent and attended to the half empty cabins with great attention to detail. OB were the old contract crew and IB was a standby mixed fleet crew not normal on this route. Food from LHR was palatable and from YVR was awful. On the return leg the IFE was faulty. The fast track OB was a free for all as we were bus fed to the aircraft on return how it should be. I feel the BBC has hurt BA with First passengers having their expectations raised to abnormal levels only to be let down by an average product on very tired equipment not as shown on TV. We were generally happy due to the fact that I used Avios and an AMEX voucher for the flight if we would have paid for the flights then it would have been disappointing and would have chosen Air Canada. BA really do need to sort out their dated equipment sooner rather than later before more premium clients opt for other carriers especially on the middle eastern and far eastern routes. We will continue to use BA due to the Avios rewards which demands loyalty for financial reasons I could not recommend for passengers having to pay for either CW or First.
6,C Cutts,Premium Economy,LHR to ARN,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,BA026 7th July Seat 66B. Arrived HK off a connecting CX flight was able to use the QF lounge close to the gate at HKIA boarding very quick and was upgraded to WT+ at the gate which was welcome after travelling from London to Malaysia and back over 3 days. I like the A380 very quiet seats are very comfortable in WT+ this being my 5th Trip on BA's 380 departed on time IFE was good however crew and food not the best on this flight I used TG between London BKK and KUL 2 days earlier in economy and the food and crew were fantastic will continue using BA for now but tempted maybe use the Star Alliance again in future.
7,Colin Pay,Economy Class,London to Dubai,Business,August 2015,False,LGW-JER return. Out on B737 back on A319 both flights almost full.80 minute delay leaving Gatwick due to French ATC strike not airlines fault. Going out no problems hand baggage only checked in online. Return a different matter unable to check in online and no self service machines at Jersey Flybe have at least six. Check in opened over half an hour after stated time when a sullen agent appeared eating an apple and carrying a newspaper. She then managed to seat by wife and I in middle seats in different rows. Customer service at Jersey shows B.A. in a bad light. The flights were fine beer and snack both ways on a 30 minute leg.
8,Jonathan Rodden,First Class,London to Brussels,Business,August 2015,False,Flew BA 025 Heathrow to Hong Kong in First Class seated in 1A July 2nd 2014. Great flight great service and cabin crew were excellent. I have flown this sector many times and this is one of best flights that I have had on BA.
9,Ryan Thomas,Economy Class,LAX to LHR,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,Travelled from OZ to watch start of TDF in Leeds. BA cancelled 7.20am flight 1340 5/7 the day before due to staff issues and changed me to a 13.50 flight and then expected me to get on the 15.30 same day return to London. Very poor and lame excuse. To make matters worse will not refund return flight of same day as on separate booking. Amazed such a big airline can't manage something as simple as staff rosters to ensure customers could get to Leeds to see the start of the 2014 TDF. What a disaster.
10,Alyssa Ablitt,Premium Economy,Denver to London,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,Travelled with my husband sister and brother inlaw to Rome via Heathrow. Yep long flight so everyone kept reminding me when I told them where we were from. Decided to upgrade to Premium Economy and thanks to our travel agent got a good deal. Several years ago I was put off from flying British Airways so thought I'd give them another go. Wasn't disappointed all flights were good considering we flew straight through to Rome I felt pretty good at the end of 30 hours in the air. The Premium Eco seats had plenty of leg room on all flights 2 bags per person even the flight from Barcelona to Gatwick which we were very grateful for. Can't say the food was anything to rave about. When the food you are eating has been on the plane as long as you have it really can't be good. Overall the flights were really good on time easy pickup of bags etc. the only disappointment is having to pay for the allocation of our seats. Apparently this is now common practice. Just be upfront about it that's all. will defiantly investigate BA again though.
11,John Frewen-Lord,Business Class,LHR to JFK,Family Leisure,September 2015,False,Flew YYZ to LHR on 1st July. Booked WT+ but was upgraded to Club World at the gate which went some way to compensate for the awful outgoing flight (see separate review). Fabulous flight very attentive flight attendants decent food (although the cannelloni was a bit dry) excellent wine Only slight negative was that the 777 is a noisy aircraft even sitting near the front. Overall this was BA at its best.
12,B Wijesinghe,Business Class,Calgary to London,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR-IAD BA 293 B772ER Club World. Checked-in fairly quickly at the T5 First Class counter due to Gold Tier status. Security speed average despite Fast Track. First Class Lounge food good and the business centre worked well. Boarding efficient in Fast Track. Left the C Terminal gate on time. Staff reasonably efficient and friendly throughout the flight. The latest Elemis wash bag is a bad joke! CW food is still quite disappointing and inconsistent with the pasta meal being quite dry. Wines and beverage choice good. The eight-year old CW seat is in desperate need of a competitive replacement. Eight across in CW is pathetic. The seamless seat cushion itself is very comfortable though the foot rest does not work well when combining the two to make a bed. If reduced to six across in CW there will be more room for the storage of small items needed during the flight and much more shoulder elbow and hip room. Thankfully I did not have to jump over anyone's feet from my window seat as the aisle seat was unoccupied. Baggage was awaiting my arrival after clearing immigration at IAD. Overall a reasonably pleasant flight but it is sad to see how the BA CW product has declined so much over the past 15 years. I am a very loyal BA customer and plan to remain so for now.
13,G Feaver,Business Class,Amsterdam to London,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,We paid top money for Club Europe and upon leaving the UK we thought it was well worth it as great helpful check in fast track immigration and lovely lounge. Once on plane saw a number of economy passengers throw their hand luggage up in the open lockers above the Club Europe passengers which we feel should be policed as the late arrivals of the Club Europe passengers had no room to put their hand luggage. Service and meals were average but really not worth the extra money especially once we got to Rome when all the Club Europe Passengers luggage was last off we waited close to 30 minutes. Hopefully British Airways will sort out the Rome baggage handlers. Flying them again next week we hope for a better experience.
14,O Reade,Business Class,MXP to LHR,Solo Leisure,August 2015,False,Montreal - LHR. I love BA but sometimes they have an off-day and this was one of them. Crew not ready when passengers boarding - some still eating their crew food. Pre-flight everything seemed rushed with no newspapers or amenity kits offered. Flight itself was fine and food very good. Landing at LHR we were parked remotely. My husband had requested assistance and we were told to wait until all the other passengers had disembarked (which took 20 minutes) only to have to join a bus with no help at all. Needless to say no one on hand inside T5 and only by flagging down a passing buggy did we manage to get to Border Control. Just not great.
15,John Frewen-Lord,Economy Class,Toronto to London Heathrow,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,Flew from LHR to YYZ on 23 June on new 787. Not impressed. Very bumpy taxiing. Smooth inflight but I couldn't really notice the extra cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to be so wonderful. I was seated in a window seat. Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since I paid £30 extra to choose my seat! Cabin crew friendly and efficient though why they didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it I don't know - safety issue if nothing else. Otherwise flight OK.
16,J Kain,Economy Class,Lyon to London Heathrow,Solo Leisure,July 2015,False,Flying from Aberdeen to Toronto via LHR. On board the new 787s on this route you can really notice the difference that they make over the 777. No drying of the eyes or popping of the ears thanks to the good air system. Although a little cramped in economy on the outbound journey I was able to secure a bulkhead seat on the overnight back. I would definitely recommend this as value for money over eco+. Just buy the economy ticket and pay to have a front row seat (there is more leg room and the same service from what I saw). The small commuter plane from ABZ to LHR and back was starting to feel pretty old and tired by comparison to the 787 however the cabin crew did a great job shoehorning in a full meal service in less than an hour.
17,Luke Toornent,Economy Class,Gatwick to Marrakech,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,I flew AMS-LGW-MCO and JFK-LHR-AMS this month. Overall is was an acceptable experience. Food and drinks the normal airline stuff. Staff were good and visited us often. I only found the seats very unpleasant.
18,A Mackenzie,Business Class,Miami to London Heathrow,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,CPH-LHR 26th June. Club Europe. BA standards are slipping. The Galleries Lounges are a shadow of their former selves. In the latest round of savings a famous business broadsheet newspaper has been axed the food offerings curtailed and sub-standard and a lack of attention to clearing tables. However the on-board service continues to be of a high standard and the Airbus 321 clean and tidy with very helpful cabin crew. Flight was marred by a lack of bags loaded on the plane due to an IT breakdown at T5 which caused a long queue at CPH baggage dept. for reporting missing bags.
19,C Denson,Premium Economy,London to Geneva,Business,June 2015,True,London LHR to Hong Kong on 27 May. Was really looking forward to flying in the new A380 but for some reason the plane was swapped on the day for a B777. Flight left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early into HK. On boarding I agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. Having ordered a vegetarian meal I let one of the cabin crew know that I'd swapped seats. When the meal was served I got told off very rudely by one of the cabin crew for moving seats without telling them - even though I had. Before I could explain my meal was dumped in my lap and he flounced off. Food was ok. Cabin crew smiles were forced. Serve the meal turn out the lights and disappear for 9 hours seemed to be the order of the day. No way was World Traveller Plus worth the extra money.
20,Jeff Smith,Business Class,LHR to PHX,Business,August 2015,True,Flew LHR to Larnaca and return 22nd April and 29th April in Club Europe. I had high hopes for Business class albeit shortish haul but was somewhat disappointed. Legroom not quite what I expect from Business class 34 inches is hardly room to stretch out. The service was good but the choice of food was limited and again not what I expect from a business class experience. As for inflight entertainment? Oh dear. On a 4.5 hour flight I expect so much better old fashioned one film option only. If you didn't like the film tough. All in all I will not rush to pay the extra.
21,Tom Adamson,First Class,Manchester to Boston via Heathrow,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,"LHR-SEA in ""first"" class. The experience was really a step back in time. Having arrived in London on JAL after an exquisite experience in their 777 first class I had high expectations of my premiere flight in BA first. Suffice to say I won't be back. Whose idea was it to jam 14 seats into a space that quality airlines fill with 6 or 8 seats? It's crowded ugly and lacks privacy. The whole cabin - and this is 'new' first I might add - feels pretty cheap and is already showing signs of wear and tear. The seat itself is narrow and displeasing. Crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines. That sums it up really - BA is simply not offering a world-class product. I can't imagine why anyone would put down the money they charge for first class unless there was no high-profile Asian or Middle Eastern alternative available and even then I'd probably go out of my way to avoid them. I suggest that BA product managers might want to go on a world tour via Abu Dhabi Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore and try out the competition because it's plainly evident that they either have no ideas or just don't care. There is apparently a ""new new"" first class planned for the 787-9 when it enters service with BA and I sincerely hope that both the hard and soft products will be worthy of being branded ""first class""."
22,Richard Bowley,Economy Class,LCA to LHR,Business,August 2015,True,I had flight from Vancouver to London and back again aisle seat I prepaid for was changed to another aisle seat which put me right near the bathroom where I really didn't want to be. What's the point of selecting a seat online and prepaying for it and then they change it with no explanation? Entertainment system was ok but the food (if you can call it that) was disgusting - chicken curry or pasta actually just curry since they ran out of pasta and left people with no choice. I've had better food on charter airlines - never again.
23,C Kay,Business Class,Heathrow to Aberdeen,Business,August 2015,False,London Gatwick to Bridgetown on Avios companion ticket. Flight left and arrived on time. Surprisingly good choice and quality of food and wine. Entertainment system somewhat limited in choice. Cabin crew were pretty poor. Generally slow particularly in responding to the call button.
24,Karagounis Paul,Business Class,London to Kuala lumpur,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR-PEK-LHR. We travel BA club world often and my overall impression is very good. Yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the Asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with BA is unbeatable. And for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is what matters the most. Contrary to general recommendations when I travel with a companion I prefer the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by using the screen you can have your own little intimate cabin. And if the flight is not full is so much better than the claustrophobic upper deck. Strongly recommended for a discounted ticket.
25,C Denson,Premium Economy,London to Berlin,Solo Leisure,August 2015,True,"World Traveller Plus from Beijing to London LHR. Old and tired 747-400 these planes really should be pensioned off now. The cabin was freezing with everyone wrapped in blankets for the whole flight. Complaints to the cabin crew just got a ""sorry we have no control over the air temperature"" response. Veggie meal ordered was given to someone else by mistake so I had to have fish. Video screen is tiny on these planes - not that it mattered as the system wasn't working properly so I couldn't watch any films. Pretty poor on a 9.5 hour flight. Sound system for communicating with passengers was very distorted so it was impossible to understand any announcements from flight- deck or cabin crew apart from a little bit of extra leg room I've no idea what extra money for World Travel Plus is supposed to be for."
26,F V Obrien,Premium Economy,Denver to Heathrow,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,London - BKK Premium economy 19/6/14. I always travel EVA Air business but this time I had to get into BKK early having been told by many that BA Business is at best rubbish I decided to save some cash and go P/Economy seat no: 14A remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and I was left with some sort of pasta dish - totally inedible. I must admit I didn't put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and hard. I was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. Drinks G&T were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least I did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor. The only redeeming factors were I didn't go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 2/4/2 configuration unlike EVA 1/2/1 lie flat and we arrived 20 minutes early.
27,Jacques Michael,Economy Class,LHR to CPH,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,Having taken several domestic flights to London Heathrow and back to Newcastle I can understand why BA have recently announced extra flights on this route. All flights full yet all credit to cabin crews who managed to supply a full trolley service. Flight and cabin crews all to a high standard of service with plenty of meaningful announcements. Can't praise enough.
28,G Mann,Economy Class,GLA to PRG via LHR,Solo Leisure,August 2015,False,Have flown with BA several times over past few years mostly economy class on holiday through travel agents. Aircraft's vary from a bit shabby with little space to sometimes a bit bigger and newer with a bit more space. Staff always efficient and polite. The one main flaw is the snack food offering - those awful wraps which are like uncooked cold cardboard. We don't need a 3 course hot meal but eg a granary bread sandwich [with a veggie filling for us] would be preferable to the dreaded wraps which we do not eat which seems such a waste.
29,Bob Motto,Economy Class,Gatwick to Genoa,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,LHR to VIE BA 704 23 June 2014. The meal service in Euro Traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the New Mixed Fleet Crew The food offering was inedible a choice of Flat Bread with Chicken Tikka or a Salad. Do British Airways not understand that not everyone likes Curry or spicy food. At least do an offering of Meat or Cheese Sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. As for the cabin crew this new Mixed Fleet with their Thunderbird Hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. At least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. This crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. I would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the Duty Free. I fly British Airways every week and this is the worst crew I have known. I think the Mixed Fleet Crew are appalling in their customer service standards they can certainly learn a lot from their more experiences colleagues who are on the old contracts so come on BA start to bring back the high standards again the new Mixed Fleet Crew are letting you down very badly.
30,Jonathan Rodden,First Class,London Heathrow to Toulouse,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,Flew from LHR to Hong Kong April 13th 2014 BA 25 and the flight took off 1 hour late. Therefore as I had an onwards connection to Jakarta with limited time to get my connection I asked on board about help with getting my onwards boarding card to Jakarta as BA in Belfast refused to issue me a boarding card. The CSD was not seen nor did he even come to speak with me even though I am GGL member. The only help I got was from one of the Hong Kong based air stewardesses who went out of her to help me. Without her help I would have missed my onwards to Jakarta. Certainly not impressed by the service. I made a follow up compliant however never received any response.
31,Kidd William,Economy Class,London to Copenhagen,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,I flew from Edinburgh to Heathrow and then on to JFK and returned from Las Vegas. The flights in the UK were fine but the flight to JFK and from Vegas to Heathrow were terrible the seats were narrow and the food was disgusting both ways.
32,V Bristow,Premium Economy,LHR to DUB,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,Flight BA 202 Boston to Heathrow. Aircraft B747 version 1. We were seated in PE. The cabin was quiet and not full so we had plenty of room. The cabin crew were very attentive and spoke to all the passengers in our cabin. Service after take off was very quick and professional the food was very good and not hurried giving us 3.5 hours to sleep. The seats were very comfortable and the extra space was appreciated. My only complaint is my TV monitor was faulty and had a black line down the screen. It was not an issue as I was planning to sleep rather than watch a movie. The cabin was quieter than economy as it was at the front of the plane and I had a good 3 hours sleep. The Flight attendants were offering drinks throughout the flight which was good. The breakfast was a croissant in a box which I found a bit of a disappointment. Overall I would fly BA Premium Economy again.
33,L Bell,Business Class,Berlin to London Heathrow,Solo Leisure,August 2015,True,We travelled Cancun to LGW in business class. To the point I didn't think the experience was as good as Virgin and Emirates who I normally use. Airport staff were helpful although I was surprised there was no lounge access at all ( we got 2x USD 22 vouchers for the restaurants in the airport). Cabin crew were not particularly attentive or helpful. Dinner and wine/drinks were nice although cabin crew had to be prompted to serve drinks again after dinner. Seat and space was ok although functionality on seat not as good as Emirates or Cathay. My friend had no direct access to aisle and had to jump over another passenger's legs. Breakfast was sub standard.
34,Robert Kovacs,Business Class,LHR to IAD,Business,August 2015,True,I was excited to fly on the new A380 with the new seating. We sat in 14j and 14k. When we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. I sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. Well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. I not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. This is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger. I was told I would be contacted by a representative but that did not happen.
35,Sears Michael,Business Class,DOH to LHR via BAH,Business,August 2015,False,Club World–LGW to TPA week later MIA to LHR. Gatwick check in quick and easy BA member came over and pointed us through Fast Track and gave lounge instructions. Lounge food offering very disappointing compared to LHR made do with Marmite on toast and lots of Champagne! In celebratory mood as going for a 30th cabin crew outbound fantastic the drinks kept flowing and never a rolled eye or any surly attitude from the crew. Managed 4/5 hours afternoon nap. Upgraded WTP home bound to CW through AVIOS 24hrs before and even bagged upper deck. An amazing night flight left on time. Have always found UD crew fantastic two pre departure drinks and mixed fleet seemed genuinely flying to serve. Only downside was pretty terrible dinner - starter and salad dreadful steak main not much better. Requested tray be taken away and skip dessert. Reclined and slept - and got woken 6 hours later for a bacon roll. Landed at LHR on time through security four bags collected and out of airport in 25 minutes. Club World and Heathrow fantastic when it goes well. Apart from food and beverage – a definite 10/10. Will be a very sad day when the 747s retire UD on A380 far more cramped.
36,Mark Gentleman,Business Class,LHR to CPT,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,EDI-LHR-FCO-LHR-EDI. EDI lounge good. Flight to LHR on time food decent attentive crew. North lounge at T5 much better than chaotic South lounge. Flight to FCO by 3 cabin 767 so upgraded using avios - fully flat beds great FA's superb food good wine. Lounge at FCO okay food not great. Flight delayed at FCO due to storms at LHR so ample time to use the flat beds watch a film and relax. FA excellent food very good again. Overall the flights and service were superb.
37,Donal Ryan,Economy Class,St Lucia to Gatwick,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,London Heathrow to Singapore. Brand New 777-300 very comfortable very clean. Entertainment was good and food tasty but very small portions. Staff functional but not friendly only one water run in 13 hours. Arrive early so cant complain. Better than Qantas flight Singapore to Brisbane.
38,L Campbell,Economy Class,Bari to London Gatwick,Solo Leisure,August 2015,True,"Flew LHR-CPT-LHR as British Airways is only carrier flying direct London to Cape Town. Outward flight due to leave 21.30 delayed by nearly 3 hours and the communication at the departure lounge was abysmal lots of unhappy passengers at the lack of information being given out. Fell asleep when finally got on board only to be woken an hour later to be given my ""special meal"" which I hadn't requested. Told stewardess it was not for me and she rather huffily took it away. When the trolley came round with the regular meals i was not offered one - this suited me as I don't relish eating at 1 o'clock in the morning but thought it rather petty of them to ignore me. Return flight was on time but had passenger from hell next to me who was too large for the very narrow economy seats so I spent the night sitting at an angle as it was impossible to sit straight with Mrs Large spilling over onto my seat. Well done to the stewardess who put up with her obnoxious behaviour with a long suffering smile."
39,D Remnant,Economy Class,London to Toronto,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,London Gatwick to Orlando. No surprises to guess that as our original flight to Tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. Due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. After finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the BA system for an unexplained reason. What an insult to have to stand in line 3 times for over 3 hours. No extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. After accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day BA then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. Our first arrangement was a flight 24 hours after our original departure time from Heathrow to Charlotte to Tampa. We did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. I declined this arrangement for a flight instead to Orlando. A longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a 3 hour drive from our holiday destination. We arrived 32 hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. To add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid £100 for not allocated to us! Uncomfortable claustrophobic seating cheap microwave style food cheap wine unacceptable and a waste of money.
40,I Jackson,Business Class,London Heathrow to Düsseldorf,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,"Club Europe - supposedly premium - had the misfortune of seat 1f - normally a great seat in Club Europe - but for a 4 hour flight LGW to ACE - cramped (not quite as bad as the rest of CE with new - not advertised - 30 inch rather than 34 inch seat pitch) - no window just a wall. Add to this limited luggage space think its EasyJet with middle seat free for £600 more. Is it worth it - no thinking avoid BA CE offering - shame I've a few flights to suffer yet. Purser - ""this is it now - get used to it"" - service downhill too."
41,Claire Shawcross,Business Class,London to Jeddah,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,We travelled to and from Europe in business class for a two week Mediterranean cruise. We upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. My first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. The food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about (take advantage of the scones and clotted cream - their only saving grace). Upon our return we awaited in London Heathrow Terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. It finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it showed we were in satellite C - it took us over 15 minutes to get there to have the gate agent tell us we should have been there earlier. She did upgrade us so we thought at least that was a perk. Well I am here to tell all - don't pay the money. There is little to no difference in first class. The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I still felt like a second class citizen. This time I think it was because were an upgrade so we were always served last and with little selection/choice. To tell you the truth if I had paid for this upgrade I would have been upset as I don't believe this is up to par. We also did a connector flight from Venice to London on the Saturday. The airport was a disaster (3 cruise ships all flying out the same time) no organization from the agents and very little help. When we got on the other side of the check in the multi-million dollar duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken some of the money to deal with the check in area. Upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon area of the airport to wait with tepid air conditioning while our flight was delayed with no explanation. When we were finally boarded we were told by the captain that the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were still going to have to wait. The last part is not fully BA's fault (they don't design the airports or determine airspace closure) however their agents did nothing to make it better either (by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates). All in all I don't believe I will ever fly BA again - this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard - now they are barely sweeping up the floor (wish they had - at least it may have been cleaner).
42,Barry Hebblethwaite,Business Class,London to Jeddah,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,BKK to LHR in club world 777-200 seat 3E and 3F on June 12th. We fly BA a lot and the service can be a bit hit and miss but this flight has been our best flight ever with BA great food and plenty of it nice choice of wine well stocked club kitchen for snacks but it was the crew that made this flight outstanding - from the start a real credit to BA.
43,H Davis,Economy Class,LHR to BCN,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,Recently travelled LHR to San Francisco and returned via Las Vegas flight BA0264. Some years since doing long haul and forget how tiring it can be. Flight out was 'ok' but return not so. Outbound spoilt by an hour or so delay when boarded as they decided to change one of the wheels glad they did though. Return yesterday not so good as flight again delayed by about one and a half hours but no real explanation. I realise people want to sleep but they can be so inconsiderate at times. No sooner in their seats and fully reclined. Meal was just adequate curried chicken but breakfast of a very hard croissant with jam a nutty bar some dried cranberries and coffee was not what I really wanted after a delayed 9 hour flight. Entertainment had good choices but sound quality was poor. Boarding process in Las Vegas was rather shambolic. Will still try and 'fly the flag' again.
44,Riaz Osmani,Economy Class,Johannesburg to London Heathrow,Business,August 2015,False,LHR-Belfast-LHR over a weekend. Ground staff and flight attendants very professional and friendly. Excellent announcements from the cockpit due to weather related delay outbound. Seats on board A319 very comfortable. Why save a penny by eliminating napkins with beverages? Very cheap indeed. The 55 minute flight both ways went quickly. Generous with drinks and the snacks were satisfactory (try the low cost competitors). BA is ideal for short haul flights within the UK and to/from continental Europe.
45,Dave Robinson,First Class,SFO to LHR,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,I flew LHR-YVR outwards 20th May 2014 on 747. The cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th June 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. The whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the TV set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats. I would be unlikely to book 1st class again with BA unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.
46,Ian Robinson,Business Class,Amsterdam to London Heathrow,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,LGW - Paphos 4th June. Check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. As we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. The lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. The food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. My wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. Having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. After a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. Why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. No pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. Pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. The crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not have been used on this route. My wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed FA said she could have hers. It was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. I was told that there was only one option left for me and I could have Kedgeree or Kedgeree so that's what I had. It was OK but not particularly hot. Arrived at Paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. Overall the flight was just OK although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. My wife did receive an email from BA within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough.
47,Bran Rovers,Business Class,Edinburgh to London City,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,Business class from Shanghai to London. It was the worst business class. Staff give the impression that they are above service and I did not feel that they were courteous or polite. On one occasion I asked for a glass of champagne and never got one on another occasion when I dropped my fork for the meal and buzzed for another one no one came when I tried to grab the attention of the staff member walking past he said sorry sir I'll be right with you and never came. Eventually I just went to the back and grabbed one. I would never fly BA again for the money you pay you can get much better business class and value from other airlines.
48,Ian Robinson,Business Class,Marseille to London Heathrow,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,Paphos - LGW 11th June. We had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from BA to confirm this. We arrived at Paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. BA had 3 check in counters open one of which was for Club Europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. We had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. I then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasn't one. After 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. The food options were OK but again not a great choice for veggies. The flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. We were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. Overall just an OK flight but BA's premier European product is somewhat underwhelming.
49,R Brown,Premium Economy,MIA to BRU via LHR,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,LHR-EWR rtn econ/premium. Very good experience as usual with BA. Having gone through the highly pleasurable T5 it was all aboard a 2 week old Dreamliner for the 7 hour outbound flight. Seats pretty comfortable for economy and new entertainment system very good indeed. Return in premium economy wasn't bad at all comfortable enough to sleep the duration of the return flight. Cabin crew professional and attentive in both directions. Will be using the service again next month.
50,John Pollock,Premium Economy,Gatwick to Bridgetown,Business,May 2015,False,BA11 LHR-SIN 11 June. This flight and the reciprocal one from Singapore to London in economy a month ago have restored my faith in BA. The aircraft was clean and in good condition; seats were comfortable staff were unfailingly attentive friendly polite and efficient. Meals were of a good standard toilets were clean and properly maintained throughout the flight. Boarding and disembarking were seamless from BA's side. One of the best flights I have had for years on many different carriers.
51,Bob Motto,Business Class,RUH to NCL via LHR,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR to DXB 11 Jun 14 Club World Upper Deck 64A - Great flight slight delay of ten mins but excellent crew on the upper deck. Food choice is excellent and service as always of a very high standard. Not too sure about the new wash bags large draw string bag with minimal contents the wash bags get bigger but the contents get smaller! Nothing really useful in the wash bag not even eye masks or ear plugs. Useful contents would be mouth wash wet wipes etc it is about time BA looked at returning to Molton Brown which was a lot superior than the Elimis range. Otherwise a great flight met by special services on arrival in DXB who whisked me through Immigration and Customs within 20 mins of landing which exceeded all expectations.
52,C Edgar,Economy Class,PHL to TXL via LHR,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,Flew from Edinburgh to New York via LHR on 5th and 10 June. All flights were very full but the service from check in to on board were very good. My only complaint was the breakfast on the return flight a croissant jam and tea or coffee which was very disappointing.
53,Nelson Laura,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Rome Fiumicino,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,Outbound BA 175 12/5/14. Return BA 286 1/6/14. Recently travelled economy on long haul to NYC and returned from San Francisco having previously done long haul with Virgin. BA knocks Virgin into a cocked hat. Love BA. Keep flying the flag!
54,V Bristow,Economy Class,Hyderabad to Phoenix via LHR,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,BA 213 LHR to Boston. T5 was very busy but check in was fast and efficient. The flight was on a 747 the aircraft was clean but looking dated. We were seated to the rear of the aircraft. The food choice was OK but both meals had curried options fine if you like curry but limiting if you don't. Lucky for us there was still a choice. My TV was broken so I had a long 6.5 hours. The flight crew were very helpful and happy.
55,R Thompson,Premium Economy,Washington Dulles to Heathrow,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,Flew World Traveller Plus for the first time. Our trip was to and from LHR from Toronto YYZ. When flying a distance World Traveller Plus is well worth the little extra. Being a big guy - tall - I really appreciated the larger seats and the extra leg room. And the on-board staff were super. Will never fly regular economy again if at all possible. Unfortunately we got caught in the baggage screw-up at Heathrow on Friday June 6th. We made it back to Toronto OK but our luggage was just delivered to our house today Wednesday June 11th. I guess that one must remain philosophical when these things happen. I'm just glad that it was at the end of our vacation and not the start. All-in-all I will definitely fly British Airways again.
56,Wallace Gordon,Economy Class,London to Nassau,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,Glasgow to LHR on a completely full flight. The crew were amazing despite being provoked by an extremely rude lady who was sitting at the emergency exit seat they remained calm and professional despite her rude and obnoxious comments. Departed on time and landed early which is always nice.
57,Ian Roberts,Economy Class,Dublin to Vancouver via London Heathrow,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR-CPH-LHR both A320s. Other than bussed to stand on the outward all was very good. The bus is unexpected at a 'new' terminal but the warmth of the welcome from the crew cheered you up a lot! Simple and tasty flatbread and drink ideal for the 1.45 journey. The return was a tad delayed due local ATC but even though only 10 mins or so the flight deck kept us very well informed and the crew came round with juice or water. Delay was made up enroute and bag appeared as I reached the carousel. Advance booking and using a few points (some I earned back on this flight) made the fare cheaper than low cost carriers. With BA renewing it's fleet the a/c seemed almost new and all very enjoyable.
58,J Doherty,Economy Class,LHR to LAS,Family Leisure,July 2015,False,Rome Fiumicino - LHR Jun 1st Economy Airbus 321. Great staff food offering poor I would have been happy to pay for a better option.
59,J Doherty,Economy Class,Boston to London,Family Leisure,April 2015,True,OSL-LHR June 8th. Two days after arriving I departed still less my check-in bag from June 6th. Flight delayed this is more often than not on most BA flights I have been on. Food offered in economy same Chicken Tikka sandwich or bean salad as seen on last 3 flights in a week on different routes. I would rather have the option to buy something I might want to eat. Cabin crew Brilliant nearly always are but its not just about the crew service but it's the only reason they have any customers.
60,G Brindley,Economy Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,Family Leisure,June 2015,True,The outward trip Manchester - Heathrow - Milan was fine with even a guide to take us to our connection at LHR Terminal 5. The return trip Munich - Heathrow - Manchester was not so good. The system would not let me check-in online and despite being the first in the queue at airport check-in we had already been allocated seats right at the back (we discovered on boarding - no plan or explanation given on check-in) with no recline. Both planes were late and at Heathrow especially the communication was poor: at one point the board said 'Please wait' then there was a 'last call' even though the gate had not yet opened; the staff seemed unconcerned at the delay no explanation or apology were offered unless they were in the inaudible announcement but I doubt it as it was quite short. Having arrived at Munich to check in at 1.30pm we eventually got to Manchester at 9pm not too late as the pilot made up some of the lost time (all excellent pilots by the way). But during this time the only refreshments were a small packet of crisps and a drink twice. Not impressive although the staff on board were friendly and polite.
61,R Tompkins,Business Class,Bologna to Montreal via London,Business,September 2014,False,LHR to DXB Return. Outbound flight delayed 2 hours just as well as it took over an hour to clear security. Remote lounge quiet nice food and wine. Jumbo on way out new interior new and very good entertainment excellent attentive crew food as usual poor - (recommend you always eat at the airport which given cost of flight one really shouldn't have to). Inbound flight on a 777. Same on way back as on way in except also on time but must commend 2 crew members for their endless patience with one clown of a passenger.
62,J Yates,Economy Class,London to Sydney via Singapore,Solo Leisure,July 2015,False,LHR-LAX-LHR. This route is the new A380 which I was very much looking forward to travelling on it certainly did not disappoint. I paid £20 extra to reserve seats in the upper deck at the very back this area is only 4 rows separated by galley and toilets and really does feel like its own private cabin. Plus the seating on the upper deck in a 2-4-2 layout means sitting by the window not only feels more spacious as you only have 1 person next to you but due to the shape of the A380 you get huge amounts of shoulder room and access to little storage lockers below the window. Flew Virgin UC on my last trip to LA in a tired and dated aircraft and BA economy was welcome. Can not recommend BA enough.
63,S Levy,Business Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,Solo Leisure,June 2015,True,"We just flew round trip on the new A380 from LAX to LHR (and then on to Rome). The A380 business class area was nice and the food was decent. However the layout of the seats wasn't great (you have to jump over the person next to you when they have their seat in a flat position). Also avoid the aisle seats as you feel like you're out in the open and people are constantly bustling by. As well the seats on the aisle have zero storage space so you are constantly getting up to get things out of the storage bin above you or losing them under your seat. The BA lounge in LAX was ok nothing great (although the food was decent) and their South Lounge in LHR Terminal 5 was just ok - very busy and crammed with people. Nowhere to relax and enjoy some downtime. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in a lounge (only things available were horrible little sandwiches a few cookies and drinks. Since LHR is the hub for BA we expected way more. However our biggest issue was with the staff on board the flights. They were highly erratic in quality. Some were very friendly and helpful others were beyond rude. I had read that British Air now has a new system where the same staff does not do the same routes on a consistent basis. There are apparently a lot of ""floaters"" who come and go and work different flights by choice. To me this seems like a big mistake and most likely causes the huge discrepancy in service. Our flight home was an hour late (BA seems to be late a lot based on the many reviews). They also managed to lose all of our luggage. We travel a lot and will no longer choose British Airways as it's too much of a ""Russian Roulette"" as to whether your service will be good or not."
64,S Lewis,Business Class,Glasgow to London Gatwick,Solo Leisure,August 2015,True,"We travelled Club Europe from Gatwick to Paphos as we were going out to get married. The extra luggage was handy due to the dress and all the extras that we needed to take but we could have paid for the extra space at much less a cost. As it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go the full hog so spent nearly £1000 extra on Club Europe seats expecting to get a really good experience. Check in was quick and easy but there was no queue at the normal check in either so we didn't really benefit from that. The lounge was nothing particularly impressive although we didn't get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. We were let on the plane first through the front of the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through the same door and through the Club Europe section so to be able to put our bags up into the compartment I had to stand by my seat until the entire plane had boarded. The seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was ""extra room"" it wasn't what I'd have expected. Our bags were marked as priority with the tags but came out with the rest of the luggage. I don't know if we went in expecting more than we should have but for the extra money we paid I think we were entitled to have higher expectations. Not an ideal way to start our wedding experience. We'd never travel Club Europe again it was a complete waste of money so hopefully others will read this and save the money to spend on the rest of the holiday!"
65,C Cutts,Business Class,LHR to IST,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR-ATH-LHR outbound 6th June. Check in and lounge good as normal at T5' boarding done by bus which I always find odd at the home hub seat 3a on an A320 I like BA's club Europe and this flight was no different. Nice happy crew and the food English breakfast was pretty good flight arrived on time bags off quickly. Return 9th June check in at ATH airport quick and polite used the lounge which is ok but pretty full with 2 flights leaving about an hour apart. Boarding quick seat 2A and another A320 appeared a bit older but comfortable enough for a 3hr30min flight crew again friendly meal service was lunch which was ok arrival T5 on time and on a gate this time. I read some reviews on here I've travelled a lot with many airlines in economy premium economy business and first have to say my experience with BA has been mostly very positive. Everyone can have an off day.
66,D Prentice,Premium Economy,GLA to DME via LGW / LHR,Solo Leisure,July 2015,True,London (LHR) to Houston (IAH) to London (LHR). T5 in Heathrow is crazy We been up and down the lifts and get train to other gates. We got boarding first then people comes in the plane. When the plane was ready to take off then 1 hour later food ready to give out to other people then nothing until 1 hour before we land. The seat was uncomfortable old and tired. The Cabin Crew were so miserable.
67,R Easson,Economy Class,DME to GLA via LHR,Solo Leisure,August 2015,True,Travelling from Venice to London Gatwick with British Airways on what should have been a painless short flight (2hrs). How wrong I was. Held in boarding queue for about 20 minutes with no explanation. Then got onto flight to find no crew to help passengers in economy with on-boarding stowing luggage etc. I was sat in very last row and became apparent that the crew were sat at the back having a laugh. A large number of the passengers on this flight were elderly requiring help putting their hand baggage in the overhead lockers. Did the crew bother to look or help? No. They were sat up the back in the galley having a right old laugh. Only when we started taxi-ing could they be bothered to finish their chat and do a lacklustre safety demonstration. Which I couldn't see as the crew member demonstrating was right at the front of the plane. I couldn't hear the pilot announcement as the audio was faulty. No idea what he said or what flight conditions were. For a nervous passenger this is not great. Took off and then the crew started for service. The food I couldn't eat as allergic to one of the ingredients and told there was no other option. Fair enough. Was offered a drink about 20 mins before landing. Just as well I had my own water I guess. Finally crew member opened locker above my head on approach and her shoe fell out on my head. Wasn't painful per say but didn't get apology from crew member at all. She looked at me like it was my fault! I fly BA quite a bit and usually never much of an issue. I found the service on this flight incredible really. I'm still pinching myself to think it was actually BA. I left the flight feeling angry and slightly depressed if this is now the standard product from BA. The plane was old no map torn seats broken arm rests and rubbish in- flight service. I really will now try to find other airlines for both UK and International flights from now on where-ever possible.
68,Mark Knowlden,Economy Class,London to Orlando via Miami,Family Leisure,August 2015,True,"LHR-VIE on an A319. Online check-in didn't start working until about 15 hours before the flight. Selected 13F on a very full flight. Selected ""collect at the airport"" option. Suddenly 8E a middle seat. No aircraft swap no explanation no apology. Boarding pass failed to work at security an error somewhere in the system told security that pass had already been used allegedly before I even got to the airport. Boarding not great with a packed bus getting a tour of T3. Flight 15 mins late due to congestion at LHR. Service efficient but not overly friendly. Much prefer Austrian on this route and will return to them for my next trip. A shame as BA should be a world beater - I'd not flown with them for about a year and it bought back memories as to why I choose others."
69,L Horn,Business Class,Beijing to London Heathrow,Business,August 2015,False,We flew LAX to LHR on the new A380-800 in Club World. Flight was on time. The flight attendants were pleasant. Food was excellent. There was a huge choice of movies to watch. The lie-flat seats were very comfortable. I am definitely going to fly British Airways again.
70,Berry Nick,First Class,London to Larnaca,Solo Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR to BOS. Day after baggage shut down but First check in easy and security quiet. Super breakfast in Concorde Room. Flight then delayed for 2 hours whilst all on board but crew were great. Food and wine superb and service was BA at it's very best.
71,S Tsoy,Economy Class,London to Pisa,Solo Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR-ARN. All the procedures at Heathrow terminal 5 were a breeze. There was some kind of baggage delivery failure at check-in but the staff managed it very well smiling and being professional. The flight went on an old dirty and worn out A319 though seats were comfortable. The service was of typical intra European flight: light cold snacks and drinks flight attendants were professional. Overall I would use BA in the future but I would prefer flying a newer plane next time.
72,Derek Salter,Economy Class,Dublin to LHR,Solo Leisure,August 2015,False,LGW to AMS. Easy check-in at Gatwick with the pods to check in and print boarding pass. Did that the night before as staying at an airport hotel. Easy and quick to drop off bag. Departure lounge easy to find. Controlled boarding. Pleasant staff and light snack on short flight. Well recommended and far better to use than T5 at LHR if you have the choice. Luggage took a long time to arrive at AMS but that is Schipol's issue rather than BA.
73,Mark Murphy,Economy Class,Lebanon to Calgary,Solo Leisure,May 2015,True,I really do not have the energy to write very detail of how bad my very recent flight too (and from) Vegas was with BA however I can categorically state I will never fly with them again and am bewildered as to how they survive a superior option as an airline. Highlights of my journey include: Severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. Delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. Running out of food and beverage 1 hr into a 11 hour flight. (No beer 1 hr in to flight - after the 90 minute delay). Uninterested and incompetent staff. Lost luggage. (1 case has so far turned up). Space reduced to less than a foot (Head to back of seat) once person in front inevitably reclines. I could honestly go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being completely honest when I say that I am an easy customer to please. If you have Virgin as an option even its a bit more expensive please take my word for it and go with them they are a class apart. BA operate as a (poor) budget airline posing as something else. Very poor journey shocking experience.
74,Charlie Harm,Business Class,Sydney to Lisbon via LHR,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,Flew in Club World for the first time on the new BA A380s. Big disappointment. The two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. The dinner service on the LHR-JNB flight was chronically slow (about three hours from beginning to end). The staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys (rather than from a trolley) and to plate all the meals. All this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers. The cabin crew were also curiously bad tempered perhaps due to the frustration of trying to deliver an over complicated meal service to increasingly disgruntled passengers. A pity as the planes are quieter than previous generation aircraft and the flight was very smooth.
75,J Rose,Business Class,LHR to DXB,Business,July 2015,True,LHR-SIN in Business on B-747. Hard to find much good to say about this experience. Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less. Would not recommend.
76,A Ward,Economy Class,Cape Town to London,Couple Leisure,June 2015,True,LHR-ATH-ATH June 2014. Both flights 1.5 hours late which always seems to be the case largely due to the old plane (767) used on this particular flight. Food average cabin crew variable-average overall. No apologies for lateness of flights which unacceptable-BA still seem to think that they are doing you a favour for letting you fly with them. Poor overall and am even considering using Easyjet as Gatwick closer to my home.
77,G Bennett,Business Class,London to Cape Town,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,Sao Paulo - London Heathrow Club World. Sat in the upper deck on the 747. Fantastic experience. Very comfortable flight with attentive helpful cabin crew. Reasonable food good selection of drinks and good IFE.
78,Linda Bowen,Economy Class,Chicago to London,Business,August 2015,False,Travelled from Barbados to London Gatwick and then onwards to Italy using British Airways in both instances. Returned to Gatwick on May 28 and again travelled by BA to Barbados. My experience in all instances was extremely positive. The flight crew on all flights accommodated my every request. The food was served at the right temperature at appropriate intervals and was tasty. I would definitely use this airline again.
79,Barry Hebblethwaite,Business Class,Washington Dulles to LHR,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR to BKK in club world over night flight. Lounge at T5 great. Nice choice of hot foods wines and snacks. Love the spa treatments. I really like the club world seats very private for sleeping. Food tasty had mushroom pasta. Good choice of films. Most of crew in club did a great job still get the odd one here and there that are surly and disinterested - make you feel as if they are doing you a favour! I always try and fly BA on the whole a great airline.
80,S Pearen,Economy Class,LHR to ZRH,Solo Leisure,June 2015,True,Flew YVR to MUC via LHR. I had high expectations for this airline but was pretty disappointed. We were flying with twin 15 month olds so it's great with BA that you can preselect the bassinet spots when booking. Crew did bare minimum seemed as though asking for anything was a huge inconvenience. Audio on IFE was awful couldn't hear any movies. Flight landed 10 minutes late in London and we were denied boarding on the MUC flight due to being late. If they allow a connection of 1h10 and you're 10 minutes late and can't get on their system is flawed. When are any LHR flights not 10 mins late! They rebooked us 2.5 hours later but after complaining put us on a Lufthansa flight 1 hour later. I never thought I would say this but will use Air Canada on this route from now on if the price is equal.
81,Robert Sakakeeny,First Class,Tokyo Narita to London,Business,July 2015,False,Boeing 777. One of our best flights from Europe. Everything was done to make us comfortable including showing the technically challenged how to work the numerous controls. Good selection of movies and shows. Food and wine selection was good and the prep was quite good. Seat was very good especially compared to the 747 outbound flight we had.
82,Murat Nal,Business Class,Manchester to San Fran via London,Family Leisure,July 2015,False,Tampa-Gatwick. Check in lousy. I can't believe I am writing this. Checking in 3 bags one weighed 32.7 kg the supervisor insisted I remove the .7kg (1lb) from the bag. I had to ask him if he was serious and he said he was. The person checking in next to me had the same problem. When you fly business class the reason you do is because you don't want stress this strictness doesn't help. Tampa airport didn't help the stress level either I had one carry on bag rucksack and a small bag for a laptop security to the gate insisted I was allowed two carry on's so I had to put two bags into one. Going through the third security the scanner showed I had something in my pocket. Body search revealed I had a few $ notes in my pocket. Security man 'when we say remove everything from your pocket we mean everything' I thought he was joking he wasn't. Lounge at Tampa Ok. Sandwiches freshly made and plenty of drinks reasonable space. Option of going to one world lounge as well. Boarding aircraft clean all seats in club taken offered champagne by very friendly cabin crew. Food usual just edible (insulting to passengers as you are paying business class monies) flight landed late. Baggage collection happy to see two of my check in's come out first and sad to see the last bag come out last as the priority tag had got removed of the last bag.
83,N Oakshott,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Milan via LHR,Couple Leisure,July 2015,True,A long time user of BA I have seen a gradual decline in quality now hit freefall and the LHR-PHX-LHR route that I use monthly has become more akin to sitting in a cattle truck than a B747. Old airframes with tatty interiors are the norm legroom is extremely limited the aircraft is seldom what you would call clean and the crews give the impression they are almost putting themselves out to serve you. Food is not worthy of the name and the whole experience is an utterly miserable 10 hours of your life each leg. Enough is enough and 1st June is the last time I'll use the outbound flight as I'm switching across to United via ORD in future. OK it means a changeover in Chicago but the recent experience was a refreshing change from BA and I actually felt like I was wanted on the United flights.
84,James Little,Economy Class,London to Vienna,Business,July 2015,False,LHR-Warsaw. Economy on an A320. Plane seemed brand new. Was seated in 8C towards the front of Economy and that's obviously a seat that gets configured for Club Europe from time to time as the seat pitch was pretty generous. Complimentary breakfast consisting of coffee and a filled croissant was perfectly OK. Service efficient. Flight left and landed on time. Textbook stuff really. No complaints at all.
85,Owen Phoneix,Economy Class,London to Sydney via Singapore,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,Gatwick to Malaga late May. I have travelled this route literally hundreds of times the number of airlines that have or currently operate this route over the years gives a good choice of flight times and fares. However I find myself using BA as the norm. The flights are well priced usually on time the aircraft are clean and comfortable although they could be newer. Legroom is great especially if you can bag a seat in the first eight rows these have 34 inches of legroom. Organised boarding makes a huge positive difference as well.
86,Bedingfield Elizabeth,Business Class,Heathrow to Vienna,Business,July 2015,True,"Travelled back from Tampa to Gatwick Friday 30th May. This flight proved that it is the crew that make a good or bad flight. This one was really bad. I was booked in Club normally the plane is a three class 777. On Friday it was a four class that was flying and I was lucky enough to be seated in the First Class cabin. Although it was not classed as an upgrade to First because it was business class service it should still have been a lovely experience. Yes the seat and all the space was great but the first words I heard as being offered a drink was - ""Can't wait for this flight to be over"". This was from one of the stewards to another steward but that attitude was the same amongst all the crew serving the cabin. I hope BA read this forum as the service really was appalling. My husband was in the bathroom when breakfast was served he was ignored. A request of a cup of coffee was met with we will be landing in 40 minutes. So what should have been a real treat turned out to be the most disappointed I have ever been with BA. Will no longer recommend."
87,C Lawrence,Economy Class,Cape Town to London,Business,July 2015,False,I flew from London to Milan Linate on 27th May 2014. Firstly the booking process was quick and easy and was matched by an efficient check-in and bag drop procedure too. The staff were well turned out and other than one cabin crew member the cabin staff were professional and polite. The airbus was modern and comfortable. A snack and drink was served on this flight and it was nice to see screen showing the route map of the flight. Disembarkation was orderly and well managed. I hope to use BA again the in the near future.
88,Shiva Raman,Business Class,Seoul to London,Family Leisure,July 2015,True,Dublin to Sydney (via Heathrow and Singapore). Club Europe from Dublin to London and club world to Sydney. Flight to Heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. Upon arrival in Heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. Upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. By this time it was about 10pm. Obviously missed the connecting flight to Sydney so tried to find a BA contact in terminal 4. Was then advised to go to terminal 1. No BA reps around and no 24 hr phone number. Then transferred to terminal 5. By this time it was midnight and still no BA contacts. Finally went to baggage services and saw a BA rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. Finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by BA they provided us with the option of flying back to Sydney on BA or could see if they could get us on a China Southern flight (we had originally booked China Southern). We took the BA option as it was easiest and needed to come home. Next day arrived at airport and boarded through Gate C in terminal 5 (hate Heathrow airport). Lounge in Heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. Upon boarding the BA business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. Seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. We had the two middle seats E and F which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. Flight left on time and arrived in Singapore on time. There was a delay of an hour in Singapore but again that couldn't be helped. They were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage - luckily it arrived two days later. Good luck if you're expecting to sleep on the flight. Seats were small and very uncomfortable. The amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. The hit towels were anything but hot. Food was below average. Overall I wouldn't recommend British Airways Club Europe/world. The best I've experienced so far from Sydney to Europe would have to be on China Southern. Considering they are 2-3 grand cheaper than British Airways and they offer a better business class product and a more seamless transfer process.
89,C Lawence,Economy Class,San Francisco to Zurich via LHR,Family Leisure,July 2015,False,Belfast City to London Heathrow on 30th May 2014. I travelled in economy class on this domestic flight across the Irish sea. The flight experience with BA started with a pleasant check-in agent who made sure I knew where I was going to and was then equalled by well groomed and friendly cabin crew. A small drink and a biscuit was offered on this route. The captain kept the passengers informed of the route and arrival was on time and disembarkation swift. My only complaint was that the announcement in Belfast was not clear and was made by somebody who was hard to understand.
90,Robert Sakakeeny,Business Class,Vancouver to Heathrow,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,BA 214 in the late spring os a 747-400. Lie-flat seats were ok but still difficult to sleep on. Seats alternated between face-front and face-rear so when the privacy screen is down you are looking directly at the other person. Service was fine with an optional dinner and breakfast and a variety of drinks. Snack basket was available all night. Business class was nice but not sure it is worth the extra cost.
91,Peter Bedson,Economy Class,New York to Dublin via Heathrow,Business,July 2015,False,MCT-LHR-MAN and LHR-MCT I think you need to fly BA every so often to remind yourself why you don't do it any more. The first flight was just poor - from check in to landing. Although they have now changed the aircraft on this route and the IFE is better they still treat the passengers as self-loading cargo. It took me 3 hours to get a drink - the staff were cheerful they simply didn't do anything. A full flight and at least one washroom out of action was an additional pain. Transit through LHR is always an unalloyed joy and this time I had to go through immigration which added to the fun but despite this I still had time for a very quick shower between flights - hooray and full marks for the lounge staff. LHR to MAN was fine. Coming back was much better the crew were responsive and pro-active and the food was actually edible - if all BA flights were like this I would use them more - I only used them this time because Swiss have axed the route temporarily while the work on the Dubai runway is happening.
92,M Lucas,Business Class,MAN-LHR,Business,July 2015,False,"Boeing 767 Club Europe to Istanbul and back. The seats were tatty and very worn leg room limited at best thankfully the passenger in front on both legs did not recline their seats. The head rests are hanging off as are parts of the cabin. The food was ok but turning out a ""plastic pot"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't that great. Even though I know they do that in the galley in first class it doesn't need to be on display. Crew much better inbound."
93,Murat Nal,Business Class,London Heathrow to Tokyo,Business,July 2015,False,Gatwick-Tampa. Check in simple lounge at Gatwick average aircraft B777. Clean and departed on time. On board pleasant welcome food just about ok after some research chose seat 4K window you won't disturb anyone getting out. But have to agree with mostly everyone else that seats are small and facing a stranger is quite odd. Cabin crew excellent flight crew informative through out the flight which landed on time. Anyone booking Business as opposed to Eco or Eco plus should know that all you are really paying extra for is a cramped flat seat and allowance of 3x32kg bag checked in instead of 2x23kg in Eco. Good films to choose from but music naff as is the screen. Brought my own in ear Bose IQ20 headset Excellent for flights.
94,Amanda Hutchinson,Economy Class,London to Entebbe,Couple Leisure,July 2015,True,My husband and I travelled to San Diego from Heathrow and back via JFK five weeks later. Service is appalling. Stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt and lazy. Food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours (the flight to San Diego is 12 hours) without access to water or beverages. Dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me. Dinner was pretty awful and the next meal: breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. The problem is staff. There needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in 'cattle class' incognito - then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain.
95,S Arangelov,Economy Class,Istambul to London Heathrow,Business,July 2015,True,"Heathrow - Johannesburg A380. My first flight on A380. After half an hour delay because of planes late arrival boarding started. First thing I noticed was how tiny the seats were. Second thing to notice is that the plane was not properly cleaned. There were grease stains and empty cans left behind. At this point I noticed some toilet paper between the panels above my head. When asked the cabin crew explained this is how they fixed condensation problem from the air conditioning. Anyhow time for lift off. I turned on the inflight entertainment system to watch it from the camera at the tail of the plane. After looking for 5 minutes I couldn't find it anywhere. (Later I found out there is no such option on BA A380s). So no tail cam fine let's listen to some music. Wrong the headphones are not working. Cabin crew assures me they will ""bring me some more"". One hour later suffice it to say cabin crew did not bring anything. I've managed to grab a pair of unused headphones from one empty seat just to find out they were not working either. Probably it was some problem with the jack in the seat rendering the whole inflight entertainment system pointless. And if that was not enough it was time for dinner. By the time it was my turn BA had run out of ""chicken"" so my dinner was asparagus with rice or something like that. You don't even have to look at it to understand why everyone else was choosing the ""chicken"". So no edible dinner and soundless entertainment system. Pretty much spent the rest of the journey counting the minutes until I could get off this plane. The worst part is I have a return trip with BA which I'll be looking to switch to another airline if possible."
96,Faye Edmundson,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Istanbul,Business,July 2015,False,I flew on Apr 29 to Belfast changing in Heathrow and also May 6th from Belfast to (via Heathrow) Barcelona then May 17 from Venice - Heathrow) then to Vancouver BC. I was very pleased with the service and meals and flight attendants were great. The only part was that changing at Heathrow was a bit of a pain having to wait to see on the board re what gate to go to but otherwise everything was great.
97,M Wilson,Economy Class,London to Faro,Business,July 2015,True,I found BA to be the worst airline I have used. Flew LHR to Boston 2hr 56 min delay to start with. Cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested. Also leg room appalling with trim falling of the seat in front of me. It had the interior of an old knackered plane. I have flown Singapore Airlines who run rings around this bunch. I could have flown with Virgin instead for the same money and would have had a vastly superior less drab experience.
98,H Stewart,First Class,Verona to LGW,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,Heathrow - Johannesburg. Concorde lounge comfortable as always. A little underwhelmed at first by first class on the A380 not as spacious or appealing as I had expected. However it had all that I needed including a very good screen for the IFE. Had the 5-course taster menu but different wines than those which were suggested. Was very good indeed did not have the dessert but the better half pronounced it outstanding. Unfortunately arrived at same time as several other long-haul flights so immigration was a pain but not much BA can do about that.
99,D Chamberlain,Business Class,Bari to Gatwick,Solo Leisure,July 2015,True,BA Heathrow to Madrid Club Euro. Disappointing service perfunctory at best with cabin crew spending much of the flight hiding behind their curtain. Full cabin but it has to be questioned why we continue to pay extra when the service is so disappointing. Flight itself was fine cabin itself not as tatty as some BA short haul. Good experience at T5 lounge at Heathrow. The afternoon tea product continues to underwhelm and underfeed - they really should change this.
100,D Chamberlain,Business Class,Orlando to London,Couple Leisure,May 2015,False,Club Europe London Heathrow T3 to Lisbon. T3 lounge very good. Boarding fine and helpful but it is disappointing that this flight consistently requires a bus to link the terminal to the plane and that there is no specific service for Club Europe passengers. There is little point in fast tracking us at other stages of the journey to ignore us at this point. Good flight excellent cabin crew - why can't BA have a consistency of cabin crew quality? Today's crew were excellent - attentive engaged appropriately friendly and amusing and consistent with their service throughput the flight. Food was fine champagne improved from previous flights. Quality of cabin still modest - upgrade of the cabins really should be a priority but I fear that BA's focus is on the long haul not those of us who travel within Europe. Efficient upon arriving at Lisbon.
101,Pranav Sharma,Economy Class,London to Newcastle,Business,July 2015,False,TXL-LHR-SFO. TXL-LHR on an A321 it was an uneventful flight drinks were served. Transfer at Heathrow was uneventful but I think that BA should give their gate numbers beforehand. LHR-SFO on Boeing 747-400. IFE was a little old and the volume was very low. Movie selection was okay. Overall it was a pleasant journey.
102,J Griggs,Business Class,LHR to VIE return,Business,July 2015,True,"San Diego return business class (the seat was more comfortable than the first class one). As usual plane was fine service was OK but not attentive (i.e just about OK). Food was terrible -I have flown BA in economy business and first - and never had good or adequate quality food. If they upped their game on this they would be unbeatable. Entertainment pretty dire - at least first had a few good ""box sets"" of TV programmes. My wife was back in economy - her comment was that the world traveller plus seat gave her backache - the economy seat was better. Her food was inedible."
103,Charmayne Buckley,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Tampa International,Solo Leisure,July 2015,False,Flew British Airways from Sydney to Venice on 22nd April and return 20th May from Barcelona. From Sydney check in staff wonderful courteous and helpful. Cabin crew just as wonderful as Check in Staff. Food out of Sydney awful. Return journey was from Barcelona. Again check in Staff were wonderful and helpful. Cabin crew just as wonderful and food was fine.
104,G Sims,Business Class,LHR-BOM,Couple Leisure,July 2015,True,Recently returned from Mauritius to Gatwick in Club World and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. Left on time. The cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of Champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. Throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. Breakfast was disgusting and served soon after take-off. A little round casserole dish of British Breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. Awful insipid coffee. After that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. Nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted I rang for a drink and nobody came. The galley 'kitchen/snack bar' was almost bare and had two manky stale smoked-salmon sandwiches and a few bottles of water. On asking for a glass (there were none) for wine I was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. Throughout the flight I felt guilty asking for a G&T or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. Lunch was just about OK and very good wine. After that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing - no tea no cakes no nothing. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 (Boeing 777) and packed in like sardines - claustrophobic for some. To access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. We were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. The IFE was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. The whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. Not once were you made to feel special or 'pampered' in any way. If there is an alternative in future to BA I'll take it and compared with some Middle-East airlines the Club World product is embarrassingly mediocre. BA needs to refresh review and up-date quickly. Sorry BA - you've lost me for the foreseeable future!
105,S Munro,Business Class,London to Singapire,Solo Leisure,July 2015,False,London to Barbados and back. After reading some bad reviews we were delighted with the service and food and both ways we had a great crew. Shame the films were not on demand on the return trip.
106,Michael Davies,Business Class,London to Kuala Lumpur,Family Leisure,July 2015,False,London Heathrow to Madrid on a Boeing 767-300. The outward flight was on a plane configured for Worldwide operation. i.e. with Club World World Traveller Plus and World Traveller classes. It was one of the newly refurbished ones. The economy cabin at 2-3-2 and leg room was excellent - I am 6 foot tall. Snack of a very nice chicken sandwich complimentary alcoholic drinks with a second run. Staff very efficient and friendly. We are Silver members of the Exec Club and the Cabin Service Director welcomed us by name. On time departure and slightly early arrival. The return flight was on a standard European configured aircraft but space was as good as the outward journey. On time departure and arrived into Heathrow 20 minutes early. Overall a great trip.
107,Connie Green,Economy Class,ATL to LHR,Solo Leisure,July 2015,True,Recently for our honeymoon we took advantage of a BA promo to fly in to Singapore and then to Hong Kong via Cathay Pacific and back to UK. Our flight out to Singapore was easy and relaxed because I think it was not a busy flight. We did ask to have a wedding photo canvas to be checked in to save us the hassle of lugging it around but was flatly refused. The canvas was less than 1kg properly packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. We understand BA has a one bag check in policy and no flexibility but we were not too bothered anyway although a little kind gesture would have been appreciated. Our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong was great! We were allowed to check in 3 pieces of luggage between 2 of us that weighed less than 40kg food was fantastic and the service was immaculate. On our way back to London we were excited as we knew we were flying the A380. SQ and Emirates have A380 we have flown. This turned out to be a mistake from the start. When we were checking in we were not allowed to check in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight of less than 40kg for all 3 items. When we got on the plane we were shocked to see how tiny the seats on the BA A380 were in comparison to SQ or even Emirates. Next we struggled to find an overhead cabin compartment for our hand luggage. The staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats. The ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. By the time the trolley came to us there were no more options for our breakfast and the food was just plonked on our trays. No apologies no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles! I was quite upset by now as I had to ask the stewardess what was being served. I have never felt more humiliated. With BA it was just silence. Miserable unhappy lifeless crews at work who can't seem to care less with their customers. No smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. Needless to say the highly unpopular dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched! Our overall flying experience with BA has been anything but pleasant friendly generous comfortable with delicious meals. It had just served as a reminder why I have not chosen BA the last 10 years and perhaps the next 10 to come.
108,R Richards,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Athens,Solo Leisure,May 2015,True,LGW-Antigua on 29 April and Antigua-LGW on 13 May Boeing 777. It started off badly when I went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 February. The system rejected both my credit and debit cards. On checking the state of my account with BA online I found that the final payment had been credited to my account and I now owed the initial deposit. I sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. First call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of English. Another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. I was told it had been sorted out and received E ticket email with my state of account showing I owed nothing. Two weeks later I received another E ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. Next credit card statement did not show money taken out. Not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. Two weeks before flight I got a phone call from BA stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. I then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. About 22 hours before flight I went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. Arrived at LGW to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. Met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ‘bring back the old system. We then had to queue to drop off baggage. Other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. Flight left and arrived on time. However the inflight main meal was the worst I have ever experienced on an aircraft. There was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. The inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to Singapore in 1962 was better. On return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. Check in at Antigua was one of the quickest check ins I have ever done. Left Antigua on time and arrived LGW on time. Food was worse than going out. No choice. Starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. Main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. White wine was just about drinkable. Coffee served as we started main course. Asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. No turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty. At least with Ryanair you know what you get for your money.
109,D Ellis,Economy Class,Orlando to London,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,LHR-JTR-LHR. A tale of opposites for BA's new route to Santorini. Outward it couldn't have been better with excellent FAs decent food and arrival that was ahead of schedule. The return started off poorly with substandard facilities at Santorini airport including no online check-in no business class lounge and no priority boarding. An air traffic controller issue kept the plane grounded for 30 minutes. On board they'd forgotten the menus for the dinner service and the starter and cheese course had been left behind. The Club Europe toilet then ran out of water. So overall okay but the return was disappointing.
110,L Lampard,Economy Class,Singapore to Sydney,Business,July 2015,False,Gatwick-Venice return. Two contrasting experiences. Trip out pretty good A320 so much better than the old 737's used at Gatwick. Staff friendly and a good snack and beverage included. Good updates from cabin and we left and arrived on time. Trip back felt like it had been crewed by brand new staff in the cabin. Food handed out 20 mins after take-off but drinks took another 30 mins to be offered around cabin. Half the cabin crew seemed too pre-occupied with passengers not sitting in correct seat even though flight not full. Think a smile and re-assurance to move back after take-off would have sorted the issue however one female crew member in particular had forgotten to bring her 'happy face' to work that day! Flight OK but not up to standard you expect. I fly BA quite regularly and choose over EasyJet as fares and flight times often similar but service superior. I hope the Gatwick service levels can reflect the BA brand otherwise they have an aggressive competitor in EJ at this airport.
111,Gerard Ward,First Class,LHR to IAD,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,1st Class LHR-PHX. Totally seamless flight. Great driver collection through concierge service (granted it was extra). Concorde room was lovely great staff and nice breakfast. First class service onboard staff were very good. Producing a very nice custom meal for my wife.
112,C Tyler,Economy Class,LHR to KUL,Couple Leisure,July 2015,True,When we booked our holiday to Barbados I was really pleased to see we were flying with British Airways as they have a good reputation. Sadly our experiences put a lie to this. As part of the service they offer BA allow you to either pay an expensive premium to choose your seats in advance or you can log onto their website for free 24 hours in advance. I tried to do this several times without success and finally rang the helpline number suggested. After a 14 minute call at premium rate the call operator (whose grasp of English wasn't great) was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book our seats and could offer nothing more constructive than “keep trying”. I rang the complaints line (still premium rate) and other than a better grasp of English was still unable to assist in any way. Both operators assured me that they would sort it all at the Airport. So in view of this we arranged to arrive at the airport early. We entered our details online to find that even though there were only 2 of us we weren't sat together or even on the same row. By now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears! We then sought assistance and had to queue but eventually we're allocated 2 seats together. As they were free I don't know why these weren't given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they don't like using them? I have flown long haul before and found that you always get a more generous allocation of space particularly shoulder and legroom. Sadly British Airways don't appear to follow this doctrine. The legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat I had about 4 inches between the front of my nose and the back of her seat. As my TV screen is in the back of this seat it made trying to watch the screen extremely difficult. I managed to watch 1 film however this brought on a headache so I was forced to stop. I would love to see what regulations BA have to follow regarding VDU viewing however in a work environment this would be banned without question. The final disappointment came when the food was distributed. I had the Thai Chicken which was over-cooked so that the rice was cremated to the top and bottom of the container whilst my wife had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. She didn't eat hers. I ate mine but had a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. All in all this was an experience I do not want to repeat and I shall certainly not fly British Airways by choice in the future! We didn't have these problems with Sri Lanka Airlines.
113,Steve Adolfo,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bangkok,Solo Leisure,July 2015,True,Travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young children) from London to Boston I hoped there wouldn't be a problem sitting together in the 4 middle seats. I had not paid to reserve my seat as I had never had to pay extra before while flying with Emirates Singapore or Cathay Pacific. The seats allocated at check in were 3 on the left (A/B/C). My wife sat with the kids while I had to sit in the row behind. The seats could not be changed at check in or on the plane. It seemed ridiculous that we were not allocated the logical place for a family of 4 in the middle of the plane even though my flight had been booked 5 months in advance. I warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me. I had to swap seats with my wife a couple of times during the flight it was a stressful flight. On the return flight I reluctantly paid extra (£23 x 4) to make sure we got the 4 middle seats. The journey was less stressful but my wife had her own issues as she couldn't recline as the passenger behind was too tall and refused to move his legs (he should have paid and extra £23 and reserved a seat with more leg room). My wife complained to the steward as the passenger refused to let my wife recline he was made to move to a different seat. In conclusion I found staff were generally friendly but didn't exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didn't have any games and the screen kept freezing. It seems the flight services to USA are not up to the same standard as flying to the Middle East or the Far East as British Airways had failed in comparison at all levels when compared with the other airlines mentioned earlier - my last experience to the USA was with American Airlines and that was worse than BA. The main disappointing issue with BA is definitely having to pay extra for choosing your seat. If you are travelling with a family of 4 and you want to guarantee you sit together you have to pay an extra £200 on top of the original cost of the return ticket this felt more like the additional charges of Ryanair!
114,David Worcester,Business Class,LHR to NCL,Couple Leisure,June 2015,False,LCY-SNN-JFK-LCY BA001 and 004. Quick check in and fast track security although I had to show my boarding pass to get expedited. Gate 24 lounge with a view of our aircraft and a glass of champagne. Quick boarding nice welcome by a familiar face. Cabin has stood up well and is as fresh as it was on introduction. Starter choice to Shannon now replaced by a selection of canapes served on a plate. USA immigration straight forward and soon back on the aircraft but the airport is soulless. Once in the air salad drinks and a choice of mains. I had the curry which was excellent followed by chocolate fondant smothered in chocloate sauce - bliss. Later on the Friday 001 flight which departs at 1245 as opposed to 0945 they serve supper rather than afternoon tea. This was a plate of cold cuts and samosas.Tasty.Quick disembarkation lovely crew. Return on 004 Sunday evening supper in the busy Galleries dining room. then quick boarding on this full 31/32 flight. Supper served to those who wanted it and then a full hot English breakfast option or a bag to go. Bussed to the arrivals hall and immigration and then home in 15 minutes. Excellent crew and flight.
115,D Leston,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare,Solo Leisure,July 2015,False,MIA-LHR in World Traveller on a 747-400. After having flown 3 consecutive legs on AA (and having been pleasantly surprised) I wasn't sure how an old BA 747 would measure up but aircraft was spotless and in full working order. Crew were friendly and helpful. The food was pretty good and the IFE far better than AA.
116,R Vincent,Economy Class,ORD to LHR,Solo Leisure,July 2015,True,Flew to Vegas on 8th May and dismayed at the standard. Filthy seat back in front of me dismissed with a shrug by a steward. Only choice of meal was a lemon pasta although some food wrapped up in foil was brought with 3 chicken meals to share between 6 of us. Sandwiches crisps and nuts etc were refused when requested as an alternative; we were told by the stewardess not to sit in the area we did (around row 31) as it normally happened. The worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude.
117,Marlene Miller,Economy Class,Vancouver Canada to London,Solo Leisure,September 2014,False,On a recent vacation from Sacramento to Paris some friends and I had a terrible experience with another airline and had some trepidation about our return flight from Paris to Sacramento. We did however choose British Airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. I am happy to report that the experience was totally different. Our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. On the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. We also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. Their screen was so far ahead I couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable. I will definitely recommend British Airways for International flights to my friends.
118,Kathleen Osborne,Economy Class,CAI to JFK via LHR,Solo Leisure,June 2015,True,I should be in a nice hotel in Romania instead 9 hours after I arrived in Heathrow courtesy of British Airways I am still in Heathrow heading back to Glasgow! The 7am flight went well 10/10 for getting me from Glasgow to London. The connecting flight to Bucharest was delayed by more than an hour which meant I wouldn't get my connecting flight to Timisoara. I duly went to customer services (waited 50 mins) who offered to get me to Timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last flight on 9/5/14 was fully booked. They offered to put me up in a hotel in Bucharest but were not able to book one. Having waited 50 mins at a BA desk where apparently there was nothing they could do to check availability of a hotel in Bucharest I was not filled with confidence. Since I was going out for only 48 hours and would miss a large part of my meeting I decided to go back to Glasgow. I was booked on the 15.50 to Glasgow and given a slip of paper with all the details and told to go to the gate when it was called as they would know all about the booking as it was on the computer. Told my boarding pass was sorted. They hadn't sorted it and I got a lecture about what I needed to do in future. There was no way I was getting on the flight told that I should be grateful as they were doing me a favour putting me on the 6.50pm flight. Told to go back to the service desk and wait in the queue again!
119,Kathleen Kirby,Economy Class,LHR to JNB,Family Leisure,July 2015,False,Once again a good flight from LHR to Warsaw in an A320. Cabin crew were very efficient and friendly on both outbound and inbound flights. I was tempted to upgrade for £72 when I booked the flights but decided not to due to the good catering service on the flight and the shortish journey. The wraps have been replaced by a flat bread sandwich which is much better! Looking forward to my next flight!
120,S Castleman,Business Class,Heathrow to Brussels,Business,December 2014,True,LGW-MRU-LGW in business. Outbound flight good with attentive staff return flight staff couldn't seem to care less had to ask for everything even water and coffee after lunch. Not what you expect in Club World from a 4 star carrier.
121,L Matt,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to London LHR,Solo Leisure,May 2015,False,LHR-FRA-LCY May 2014. LHR-FRA on a 767 row 18. Checked-in via the mobile app no bags to drop as a day trip. BA Galleries South for a quick spot of breakfast. Boarding started 20 minutes before departure. Not a full flight. Left slightly late due to cargo being loaded but arrived on time. Standard seating and food for BA short haul European flight. Return FRA-LCY on a E70 Row 15. Use of the JAL lounge at FRA opposite the gate area. Bus to the aircraft and an on-time departure. Full flight and not much room up above for carry on items on this aircraft on a full flight. Legroom quite tight in row 15. Again standard food and drink for a BA short haul service.
122,Colin Pay,Economy Class,LHR to LAX,Couple Leisure,July 2015,False,Rating : 10/10 Cabin Flown Economy Value for Money Seat Comfort Staff Service Catering Entertainment Recommended
123,Jeff Suykerbuyk,Business Class,London to Singapore,Business,July 2015,False,08/5/2014 JFK-LHR-BRU. After the perfect outbound flight we thought that the inbound flight could not be the same. The lounge is JFK was very crowded and not really relaxed. Boarding was again relaxed with a perfect crew on the Upper deck friendly and relaxed. Slept nearly the all flight in perfect conditions. The flight LHR-BRU was delayed with more than 40 minutes but the captain excused humbly for the delay and gave us plenty of information. business cabin was full but the service on this short flight was more than excellent.
124,Andrew Allen,Business Class,LHR to EDI,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,Belfast-Heathrow-Frankfurt return. Very impressed with the service and crew especially on the Frankfurt-Heathrow sections as the Belfast ones are only domestic but still excellent. I was impressed with the food which was a hot chicken dinner going out and afternoon tea on the return leg. The crew were really exceptional and make this airline as the seat pitch in Club Europe is poor. Their Galleries lounge in T5 is just OK being a bit of a cattle market compared to the Sukara longge in Frankfurt which was superb.
125,Jeff Suykerbuyk,Business Class,Gatwick to Dubrovnik,Couple Leisure,May 2015,False,2/5/2014 BRU-LHR-JFK. Short flight in business from Brussels to Heathrow was how a short business always has to be: excellent crew decent food flight was on time. Flight from LHR to JFK started in perfect conditions: First lounge in Terminal 5 (as a gold member) with excellent champagne and food and place. Boarding was smooth with helpful crew a nice drink to welcome us on board and to relax and a nice smile. In one word the start of a perfect flight in a full cabin landing on time in New York. This is how it always should be.
126,S Snehal,Economy Class,LHR to Hamburg,Family Leisure,June 2015,False,While different people have different experiences I wanted to share that I have mixed reviews both are great - one can be used as feedback while the other for pat on BA's backs! I was traveling BLR-LHR-SFO route on 9th of May 2014. The first flight from BLR-LHR was chaotic and as mentioned by others on this site most food options were exhausted by the end of the flight. I don't complain because I got my food choice. The flight staff had some really courteous people while some were pretty snobbish. The second flight is really what's worth mentioning - it was the most cheerful flight I have been on! The flight attendants were entertaining the pains of being on a second leg of a 24 hr journey was not felt. BA 287 flying on 9th May 2014 - fantastic flight. Food was okay - I loved the Lily O Brien chocolate mousse! Entertainment - its high time BA upgrades its entertainment systems. The audio was lousy and nothing was clear or audible even on the highest volume against the aircraft sounds.
127,G Thomas,Business Class,Shanghai to London Heathrow,Business,June 2015,False,Caught a connection from Gatwick to Jersey and it was fine. A very short flight with very efficient and effective staff. Not much more I can say because we were up and out so quickly. I was travelling business and it is about time a little more space was made in the cabins. If you cannot cross your legs then why are you paying for business class seats?
128,Loraine Droy,Premium Economy,Helsinki to London,Family Leisure,May 2015,True,I have just been reviewing all the reviews on this website and it seems every evident to me that if you are booked in First class you will more than lightly have a great flight economy or premium is touch and go! If you want to take the risk I travel BA to Tampa premium economy three times a year the food is disgusting and I always sit in aisle 14 now if anyone has booked there seat in this aisle be warned they run out of choices on the menu when they get to you and they offer you an economy meal and quite frankly they do not care if you complain well I complained! Myself and the man seated next to me kept up the complaining and 15 mins later the steward comes up with two beef dishes. The crew had kept these meals for themselves. So be aware that if you are seated in aisle 14 bring your own food because you will not get a decent meal.
129,S Goff,Economy Class,Chicago to Paris via London,Couple Leisure,July 2015,True,Flew from San Francisco to Heathrow London. Flight was delayed 3.5 hours the food particularly the breakfast was the worst I've had on an airline. The sets were very uncomfortable. I feel BA have a long way to catch up to the quality to other airlines such as Emirates and Qatar.
130,Tanmay Bhakta,Premium Economy,Istanbul to London,Business,July 2015,True,I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.
131,P Harris,Economy Class,Bangkok to London,Business,July 2015,True,"Lanzarote to Gatwick on 13th April. Flight itself was okay but on arrival we were ""parked"" a long way from the baggage reclaim area (for which the Captain apologised). After a 30 minute walk from the plane our problems began as we then waited another more than 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. Many flights that landed a long time after us received our bags and set off home far more promptly. BA have acknowledged they are responsible for the journey from ""start to finish"" but have gone on to advise that some parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. Can't recommend BA because of this experience and because of the way our subsequent complaint has been handled. Not planning to use BA again because of this."
132,A Amaladoss,Business Class,Dublin to London City,Business,June 2015,False,LGW-VRN-LGW both in Club Europe. Was offered an upgrade on the way out for £85. Swift check-in as Gatwick was quiet at 6.30am. Used the Galleries lounge-reasonable cold food selection but the only hot option was porridge. Nice atmosphere though and good views of the runway. Left slightly late due to congestion. Nice breakfast with individual bottles of Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. Bags delivered quickly. Return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. BA use the Catullo lounge which is very poor with an abysmal selection of food-nothing hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm! The lounge is before the security check so not able to relax altogether. Crew very apologetic about delay speedy drinks and meal service-the chicken curry was passable.
133,Alan Clare,Economy Class,Sydney to Singapore,Business,July 2015,True,6 May 2014: Las Vegas to Gatwick. Boeing 777. Back on BA again thanks to Avios Companion coupon. Cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. Certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. I've flown AF TAP SWISS KLM long haul in the past year and by far BA catering in economy is the poorest in content. Yesterdays offering for Breakfast was almost an insult.
134,A Amaladoss,Business Class,London to Istanbul,Business,July 2015,False,LHR-YYZ in business was looking forward to a B787 but this flight was a B777. Had the rear facing seat- comfortable enough but it is always awkward trying to clamber over the passenger seated diagonally opposite. Enjoyed the plentiful supply of pink champagne. Lunch was fine as was the afternoon tea. IFE screen on the small side but managed one movie. Crew were pleasant friendly and efficient.
135,C Thomas,Economy Class,Singapore to London,Business,June 2015,False,"I'm not normally one to whine but here goes. LHR-CDG at 0725 on a Tuesday morning via the dreaded gate A10. Plenty of ""Fast Track"" signage and we fast trackers were herded through the checkpoint onto a bus where we waited until we were joined by all the other passengers! Outstanding! Flight OK (fairly grubby ex BD A320) but the pointlessness of a non fast Fast Track amused me no end."
136,Berry Nick,Business Class,London Gatwick to Orlando MCO,Family Leisure,August 2014,False,JFK to LHR. Empty check in and priority security quick. New food selection in First class lounge but preferred the decent meal in the dining room. Boarding easy and upper deck crew excellent as lights not turned on until just before descent with arrival on time. Bus to terminal but bags waiting when we got there.
137,C Denson,Economy Class,LCY to JFK via Shannon,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,Chicago O'Hare to London Heathrow on 2 May. check in very fast and efficient. New 777 plane. Take off and landing about 30 minutes late. Friendly flight crew. Efficient service. Good vegetarian meal. Very pleasant flight.
138,A Hickling,First Class,London Heathrow to Dubai,Business,June 2015,False,Travelled to HKG on board the new A380. Boarding was efficient with a dedicated air bridge for First passengers. Welcomed on board offered champagne newspaper pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. The space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. The food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. There are also treats available in the first galley. Breakfast was also very good. I managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. The crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. The entertainment system was the Thales product. Plenty of choice interactive screens and no rebooting as is the case on other long haul aircraft. I couldn't fault this flight just a pity I couldn't spend longer on it. Looking forward to the return journey.
139,Iain Henderson,Economy Class,Gatwick to Orlando,Family Leisure,July 2015,True,"BA 059 London to Cape Town April 29 2014 economy. It's been a while since I flew BA world traveller and it will be even longer until I use them again. Clapped out 747 terrible uncomfortable seats awful back of seat video system. - my partners failed. The crew seemed totally disinterested and disengaged and far more interested in getting the ""service"" note the quotes over with ASAP. all they wanted to do was to retreat behind the curtain and gossip. Perfunctory drinks service - when asking for a whisky and soda I was offered whisky and tonic. Paper cups for coffee at breakfast. Meals are better at a Little Chef. The amenity kit was an ancient set of headphones and a toothbrush. Never again. Wake up BA there are major competitors out there and next time it Emirates via Dubai."
140,G Pardoe,Business Class,Heathrow to Warsaw,Solo Leisure,July 2015,True,Las Vegas-LGW 777 3 class. Business. The unique forward facing/rear facing seat configuration fits in more seats than other leading airlines. Try to get a window/aisle seat if you are travelling as a couple but you will be lucky unless you are prepared to pay £60 to choose your seat. Otherwise you will be allocated a seat 24 hours before the flight and there are limited choices to change your seat allocation on a busy flight. In the middle 4 seats you will be either facing someone during service take off and landing or sat next to someone with a small partition between you. In all seats the foot rest is part of the bed and blocks access so you will either have to step over or be stepped over to leave your seat. The seats were comfortable in all positions. Dinner was average but less elegant than meals on other leading airlines. Breakfast was a disaster; hardly any of the choices on the menu were available but no explanation or apology were offered which was typical of the functional unsmiling flight attendants. We got a good price in a BA sale but the overall experience was disappointing.
141,Guy Senior,Business Class,JFK to TAV via LHR,Family Leisure,July 2015,False,An interesting contrast on recent Gatwick to Turin and back flights. Going out it was a (new?) A320 which was bright clean and spacious. On the way back it was a B737 which was clean but a bit tatty and felt cramped. Service food and drinks on both flights was commendable. I believe that all of BA's 737s retire by the end of the year which cannot come too soon.
142,Jack Hughes,Economy Class,Toronto to Rome via London,Family Leisure,June 2015,False,Heathrow Marrakech. Had previously travelled on the British Midland service with mixed results. Things seem to have improved since the take-over and integration of services. Staff more attentive both on the ground and inflight. Meals seem to have improved too. There has been a real lack of choice on this route (still is) but hopefully the improvement will be consistent.
143,Bruce Bettridge,Business Class,Rotterdam to London,Family Leisure,June 2015,True,Business LHR to BKK. 747-400. First try back with BA in about 5 years during which I have flown many other airlines and been impressed with most. The only things that impress me with BA are the staff and their ability to pretend this is a quality airline and the fact that people pay BA so much money to be treated like cattle. The Food is without doubt some of the worst I have had in Business anywhere poorly presented badly prepared and barely edible. The AVOD looks like it was installed 10 years ago and then wasn't the top of the range screen size is terrible viewing angles and resolution poor. The seats work well as a lie flat configuration. That's the highlight. I cant help feel that if BA senior managers occasionally used their own money to fly with rivals then we would see real change from our national flag carrier. Regretting my already booked return flight and my 550000 BA air miles.
144,J Robertson,Economy Class,Chicago to Berlin via London Heathrow,Solo Leisure,July 2015,True,"This was a bmi Regional operated flight on a RJ145 from Manchester to Heathrow - but with a BA flight number so I have to report it on here. On boarding the cabin crew member didn't look up to check our boarding passes or welcome us. No check on seatbelts etc. prior to takeoff. The service started soon after takeoff since this was a very short flight this consisted of a trolley with drinks and snacks - as is usual on BA Domestic services. There were 5 men in front of me returning from a weekend break who were given 2 gin and tonics each and the cabin steward was very friendly with them. He got to me and stared I stared back I took it he had forgotten to say ""may I offer you something from the bar"" or something similar. I asked for an orange juice and that is exactly what was thrust onto my tray. I asked for ice I got one lump splashed into my juice reluctantly. None of the rest of us were offered a further drink but then we didn't expect it on such a short flight. No goodbye to most on departure just a grimace - but that didn't surprise me. It is sad to see that the bmi staff have lost all sense of pride in their jobs."
145,W Benson,Economy Class,LHR to JFK,Solo Leisure,June 2015,True,LHR-HKG on Boeing 747 - 23/08/12. Much has been written about the tired old 747 fleet so I won't go in to that. What was annoying was that I was 4 rows from the front of the World Traveller cabin and by the time the crew had got to my row to serve lunch 1 of the 2 choices had already run out! That in itself would have been ok - it was perfectly acceptable pasta but the starter was a pasta salad. Not very sensible offering 2 dishes almost the same. The crew did what was required of them - serve drinks and food but then we didn't see them again for 9 hours until breakfast was served. I flew home in New Club World (see separate review) and my advice would be to fly in the best cabin you can afford. On a 12 hour flight it really is worthwhile.
146,S Luqman,Economy Class,Heathrow to Ibiza,Couple Leisure,June 2015,True,Just got back from Bridgetown Barbados flying with British Airways and frankly couldn't wait to get off. I was so disappointed. I have travelled regularly with BA but the flights going over and coming back left a lot to be desired. The plane was in need of repair. I had water dripping from the ceiling where I was sitting and when I told the stewardess was told that was usual due to condensation and proceeded to stuff a tissue to stop the dripping. The toilets were so old that bits of the cladding were coming away. The food was awful and inedible. The staff were unapproachable and looked fed up. BA get your act together or you'll be losing flyers by the hundreds.
147,D Smith,Economy Class,London to Los Angesles,Solo Leisure,October 2014,True,"LHR-JFK-LAX-LHR. Check in was ok apart from being snapped at for being too early to check in come back in 5 minutes. Got through security quickly. Terminal 5 has very good facilities. We boarded the aircraft and sat in our seats realising we had a long haul flight in short haul seat pitch with a very small seat width designed for a below averaged size person. This wasn't at all helped by the passenger in front reclining their seat immediately after the seatbelt sign went off. Food was basic small meal return flight included a breakfast consisting of a small bread roll with a bitesize cereal bar. Both legs went at least 4hrs without any food/drink service. IFE was quite good have to watch 5 minutes of adverts before the programme starts. Family near us had a child with no working IFE for return flight. What annoyed us most was on the return leg we were told by the flight attendant ""Do you mind moving forward so the couple behind you can eat?"". We did presuming it was policy whilst finding it strange it never happened on the outbound flight. No one else was asked to move the seat forward so we felt angered that we were the only ones asked. It is 100% not surprising BA has fallen behind other airlines in recent years as middle eastern airlines such as Qatar provide a much better service for a similar price."
148,W Benson,Business Class,YUL to FCO via LHR,Family Leisure,June 2015,False,HKG-LHR in New Club World on Boeing 777-300 - 26/08/12. Bought ticket in WT+ and managed to get a last minute upgrade using Avios to Club. First time in a premium cabin. The seats are comfortable if a little narrow but they easily move to the lie flat position meaning I was able to get 6 hours sleep. Plenty of good quality champagne and wines offered before and during dinner. 3 course dinner sounded a lot better than it actually tasted. BA should think more about ease of food preparation on board rather than trying to do lavish dishes that don't quite come off. Breakfast was better than expected - plenty of choice and a good selection of fresh rolls and croissants. AVOD worked well. My only complaint was that the cabin crew found it very difficult to be friendly. Every request appeared to be an inconvenience to them - little things like milk and sugar for my coffee. Generally though I would have to give Club World the thumbs up if only because a lie flat bed is infinitely more appealing than cramped Economy on a 12 hour flight. As I was in Club through an Avios upgrade I cannot comment on the value for money. Had I paid full fare I might have expected more.
149,Michael Dielissen,Premium Economy,Washington DC to Heathrow,Couple Leisure,June 2015,False,YYZ to LHR - July 2012 - I flew overnight in premium economy on a 767. I chose this flight because on the 767 the layout is 2-2-2. I chose an aisle seat in the middle 2 so I could go to the washroom etc without disturbing y seat ate and vice versa. The seats are comparable to North American business class except with narrower arm rests. (better than economy but still not meant for sharing). The entree food was the same as business class and I wasn't really impressed. It wasn't bad but wasn't good either. I would definitely fly BA on this route again mostly because of the layout and the option to fly premium economy.
150,D Nolan,Business Class,Berlin to Chicago via LHR,Solo Leisure,November 2014,False,Flew return in CW from LHR to BKK in August 2012. The positives of both flights were: they were on time seats were comfortable and lounges were good. The negatives were: very poor food selections on board (over cooked and uninspiring) very mixed crews - depending on what side of the aircraft you sat you got a totally different in-flight experience - some of the cabin crew should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the IFE was unreliable - on both flights the IFE had to be re-set at least once. Overall the flights were fine and I will use BA again if the price is right.
151,J Tinning,Economy Class,Vienna to London,Couple Leisure,November 2014,False,Flew LHR - VIE return operated by bmi but BA aircraft. A319 aircraft was clearly new and very clean. The crew were smiling friendly and helpful. No in-flight entertainment but not a problem on this short-haul flight. Delicious lunch was served - ham and mustard sub roll and unlimited drinks available. Have flown British Airways on this route many times now and they have never had a flaw in decent service and staff whether on the ground or in the skies.
152,C Mcculloch,Economy Class,London to Vienna,Couple Leisure,June 2015,True,Flight from Heathrow to Toronto. Booked emergency exit seat for night flight home. Cost £55 but worth it. Overall was ok both ways except for awful breakfast prior to landing at Heathrow. A freezing muffin in a piece of plastic and a polystyrene cup of coffee. Not a cheap flight - better value with Air Transat club which costs about the same and is better in every way.
153,Nick Berry,Business Class,LHR to FCO,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,LHR to HAM. Purser addresses all club passengers by name boarding a little late but left on time. Food good for short flight. Overall excellent.
154,Avril Barclay,Economy Class,LHR to Grand Cayman via Nassau,Couple Leisure,June 2015,False,My son who had worked for British Airways urged me to fly British Airways to Kansas City. He recommended me to join the executive club. I went ahead and booked my flight back in May. Very reasonable price. As they are in an alliance with American Airlines my outward journey was with American Airlines. They were helpful even booking my seats to Chicago then onto Kansas at no cost. Problem was on my return. I duly waited to book my seat on the Chicago flight 24 hours prior to check-in. As this was with BA I tried for an hour to choose a seat to no avail. My itinerary came up but told me I was being redirected to American. So I called BA they told me I was to check in at Kansas City before I could have a seat assigned. So I called American a very unhelpful person told me that I had to go to back to BA. I called BA again after explaining I had seat booked with American from Kansas but could not get one with BA she put me on hold for 15 minutes and told me I had a seat - trouble was it was the one from Kansas to Chicago. Perhaps the powers that be can sort this out. It was most frustrating. The journey was fine staff polite in-flight entertainment excellent.
155,C Volz,Premium Economy,Santorini to LHR,Couple Leisure,June 2015,True,London City-New York JFK via Shannon on A318 but had really nice seats and professional crew. Meal served was very tasty and fresh. Overall a very good flight would use this airline again.
156,Russ King,First Class,London Gatwick to Glasgow,Solo Leisure,May 2015,True,SIN-LHR BA12 B747-436 First Class. Old aircraft (1998) with seats that are not that private but there are only a few of us in the cabin so ok. A bit tatty but I think the planes are being replaced by A380's soon. Seat itself is comfortable enough. Inflight Entertainment awful: fuzzy screen (low resolution LCD screen way passed it's sell-by date) with limited options. Inconveniently has to be pulled around to be seen and put away for t/off and landing. seat comfortable enough for sleeping. Food and service quintessentially English which is the only real reason to fly BA nowadays - the product just doesn't match other airlines. Toilet cramped and awful but it has a window!
157,Tony Laverghetta,Business Class,London to Johannesburg,Couple Leisure,June 2015,False,LIS-LHR on 30 July J class on an Airbus 320. I was expecting more however I was disappointed. Seat was OK but not particularly comfortable food just average with a choice of a fruit or meat platter either very poor. Cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what. No inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie. However we departed on time and arrived 15 min before schedule and the price was the cheapest ever for a Business Class seat. Will fly BA again but I am more keen to Intercontinental flights where the quality is superior than European routes.
158,Holder Timothy,Business Class,Naples to London Gatwick,Couple Leisure,May 2015,False,Upgraded from Premium Economy to Business from YVR (Vancouver) to LHR (London). The Club World cabin was full and a couple of the passengers had been upgraded to First. Despite this the staff were friendly and helpful although the food wasn't that great (the chocolate desert was delicious though). Seat is nice and wide but if you're facing rearwards on the 747 you could be sitting right next to someone you don't know. The IFE had a lot of choice and had many new movies to chose from. Altogether a good flight.
159,Corden Andrew,Business Class,Geneva to London,Business,April 2015,True,Upgraded to business class on return flight from Verona. Absolute disgrace. Flight left around 11.30pm but lounge closed at 9.20pm. Lounge was awful dirty and very little in the way of business class facilities. Flight was cattle class and I have seen more organisation and courtesy on an easyjet flight. Boarding was like a rugby scrum with no priority boarding and then spent 20 minutes on an a bus with no air conditioning crammed packed in hot conditions. Flight had run out of food. Worst flight in memory and absolute shocking customer service. Absolute joke and how they have the audacity to claim it was business class they should be accountable n the trade descriptions act.
160,Tony Hall,Business Class,Vancouver to Berlin via London,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,AMS-LCY economy. Embraer aircraft only half-full at most and on time. For such a short flight a high standard of cabin service with wine and a small snack offered. An excellent flight in all respects.
161,Tony Hall,Economy Class,LHR to LUX,Business,June 2015,False,Porto-LHR economy. Pushed back late but arrived on time. Flight was full but good cabin service with sandwiches and drinks. A very good standard overall.
162,W Benson,Economy Class,LHR to NCL,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,LHR-CDG-LHR. Outbound A320 on 26/7 return A319 on 27/7 in Euro Traveller. Both flights boarded efficiently departed and arrived on time. Seats were a bit tired but comfortable enough for a 60 minute flight. Exit row (9) on A319 is worth taking if available as it provides extra legroom. Refreshments only as the flight is too short for anything else.
163,Mike Palmer,Business Class,LHR to Santorini,Couple Leisure,June 2015,False,"Toronto to London in WTP on a 787 and London to Toronto in club world on 747. There were elements of both flights where BA seemed to be back to their old self. The Dreamliner in WTP was on time with some of the best cabin service I've experienced from a male attendant who smiled couldn't do enough and was just professional. BA seemed to have dropped some of the nice touches though so no hot towel soft drink before take off or menu cards - looks like WTP seems to have been demoted (again). Fast bar service and good entree before the WTP service morphed into WT for breakfast which has reverted to ""muffin or nuffin"" and Ts and Cs and juice from paper cups. It really is an insult after an overnight flight and is ill thought out and penny pinching. Landing early at Heathrow and fast bags ended a good overall flight. The return flight in club was one of my best ever. The lounge had a better range of hot and cold food though most of the furniture still needs replacing. On board two male crew upstairs on the jumbo were superb. Friendly helpful and starting off well with a 2nd champagne before take off due to delays in boarding. Fast bar service and an excellent lunch with the sea bass being exceptional. A calm oasis on the upper deck allowed some sleep before the now tired afternoon tea was served. Real personalised service with a smile reminded me of old times of BA at it's best. An on time landing and fast bags off finished an excellent flight. Why can't they do this more often? (Answer - variable cabin crew)."
164,T Kohn,Economy Class,LHR to MIA,Solo Leisure,May 2015,True,12/2013. LHR-LAX. A380. Aircraft was clean. Seats were comfortable but the leg space was restricted by the IFE- computer which has been installed underneath the seat in front. Amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphones and toothbrush. There were no eye shades and ear plugs. Food both ways the same selection: Tikka Masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant. FA's lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation. There was on both flights repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hours not present in the cabin. IFE-system is good with a big selection of movies documentaries etc. Due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preferences. This experience with British Airways is not compatible to other flag carriers due to the lack in service and the restricted seating.
165,G Smith,Business Class,Bangkok to Heathrow,Couple Leisure,July 2014,False,LHR-SIN 26 July 2014. Upgraded from WTP to Club World before I even had the chance to ask. Value for money was a '5' because I didn't pay for the flight! Flight went well and I even managed some sleep on the fold flat bed. Cabin crew were pleasant and helpful one of the attendants retrieved his own USB adapter from his luggage so that I could charge my phone (I was a little surprised that there wasn't a USB port at my seat - upstairs 747). The same attendant appeared in the passport control hall and called out - without success unfortunately - looking for a passenger who had left his glasses behind. Food was absolutely fine and the Burgundy a little too drinkable. This was probably up there as one of the better flights I've taken - most are done under sufferance but this one was pretty good overall.
166,Jim McCormick,Business Class,Buenos Aires to Heathrow,Business,May 2015,False,26th July LGW to Orlando. Drinks service from the crew was good. Champagne upon boarding and a top up without requesting. It was greatly appreciated! Food was not outstanding but pleasant enough. Overall the cabin service was good. Several services of drinks and top ups when requested. What let this flight down was the number of unruly children on this flight. I was in an outside seat on the port side and an 8 or 9 year old child in front got out of her seat every five minutes or so continually throughout the flight and her younger sibling was also jointing her when she did manage to stay put. I attempted to avail myself of the flat bed but three times these children stood on my legs as they clambered over into their seat. The parents of these children never once intervened to check their children's behaviour although they were well aware of how they were behaving. My wife did not have much luck either. The couple to her rear were sat throughout the flight crossed legged in the isle playing with their children and their toys and my wife had to struggle passed them every time she wished to use the toilet. Surely a tripping hazard! There were many other children on the flight who were well behaved so it can be done if parents set boundaries for their offspring. Whilst BA cannot be held responsible for children's behaviour I feel that as we were in the Club World cabin some sort of announcement should be made by BA requesting passengers with children respect the comfort of fellow passengers. P.S. The Club Lounge at Gatwick was like a kindergarten but that is another story!
167,J Whittle,Business Class,Los Angeles to London to Paris to Rome,Solo Leisure,June 2015,True,"LHR-CPH-LHR Business Class. This is a joke. Scruffy aircraft with ripped upholstery dirty cabin and chaotic/slow ""service"". I know it's a short flight (90 mins) but it shouldn't take over an hour to get one cup of cold stewed tea. Flight attendants including their ""manager"" didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing. Seats are actually narrow economy 3x3 configuration with the middle one kept vacant. Inflight entertainment? Easy there isn't any. For the price I paid this was an absolute disgrace. I seriously think I'd have a better experience with EasyJet."
168,Cutts Craig,Economy Class,LHR to BKK,Couple Leisure,June 2015,False,LHR-BSL-LHR 22nd/23rd July BA748 and BA755 A319 each way bag drop at T5 seemed to take ages. Once through used the North lounge which was pretty full at this time of the day. Flight delayed a little and arrived about 15min late service on this 1hr 20min flight was fine for economy class a sandwich and drink supplied return bag drop in Basel quick used the Euro Lounge which was very nice. Return flight quick boarding very full a sandwich and drinks served and again service good for a short flight arrived T5 bit late but bags recovered and out in 30 min.
169,N Salisbury,Economy Class,LHR to Milan Malpensa,Solo Leisure,June 2015,True,We flew to Rome from Newcastle via Heathrow the ground staff service was excellent at Heathrow as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home I received a text at 17.30 to say our flight had been cancelled but could not contact customer services for over 14 hours we were told we had been booked on an earlier flight which meant taking a taxi to the airport losing the money we had already paid for our previous transfer and the disability assistance service we receive in Heathrow was awful. We were left for 1 hour for someone to take us from the plane and then at the next station there was no one to take us to our flight connection so I had to push wheelchair myself.
170,Sander van Kan,Economy Class,Seoul to London,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,Flight BA274 LAS-LHR on 8/6/2014 onboard G-CIVB (B747). Flight was on time and smooth. Catering was very average and small portions. Quality was much less then BA standard. Crew was good but we didn't see them for a very long time during this flight. Only 2 drink rounds were made during this 9.5 hour flight everyone knows that is not enough. Seats were good with just enough legroom.
171,Alan Skinner,Business Class,London to Turkey,Couple Leisure,June 2015,False,BA2262 on 17th Feb 2014. I was in 4A from Jamaica to London Gatwick and no need to climb over anyone’s legs and you're close to the toilet and the galley were your can help yourself. Seat is very good and good space. Great meal I had the Chicken Curry very good and a nice bottle of wine to help it down. The Stewards were very helpful. Going to Grenada soon and see they have first on the flight so going to try that.
172,A Hickling,Business Class,Abu Dhabi to Muscat,Solo Leisure,May 2015,False,DME-LHR July 23 Club World seat 64A. It was quite a novelty travelling on a 747 aircraft for a flight just over three hours long. I sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. I chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. I did not use the seat as a bed but used the Z position which is very good for relaxing. The food and wine choices were very good and the Club Kitchen was well stocked on the main deck for treats after dinner.
173,A Hickling,Business Class,LHR to YYZ,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,LHR-DME on 19 July seat 1A Club World. I flew on one of the converted A321 jets that BMI used to own and was very impressed with the seat. The configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function. The TV screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat. The service was excellent from two male crew members and the food and wine selection was of a high standard.
174,Kay John,Business Class,LGW to VCE,Couple Leisure,May 2015,True,BA206 from Miami to LHR on upper deck dinner took over 3 hours to complete. 2 staff obviously not sufficient. Very old 747 TV screens going from colour to B&W frustrating as had more than enough time to watch a couple of movies while dinner was not served.
175,Brenda Watkinson,Economy Class,LHR to SOF,Business,May 2015,True,I have used BA over the past 20 years as I chose to move my airmiles to their plan regretted it ever since and will use them up as soon as possible. Even when flying on a paid flight I find the staff snooty they have a bad customer attitude. At the moment I am trying to check in on a flight only chosen because it was the best option for my multiple stops and the on line check in does not work. Told by staff member never mind just do it at the airport not much point in reporting it because they won't do anything for 24 hours. That is good customer service as you can only check in 24 hours before hand. I have had lost luggage twice on the same trip had my seat changed for no reason (someone else was able to use my original choice so not a seat problem) flights changed but was able to change them back to the original booking. I have travelled economy and premium economy and flown 10 hours with no inflight entertainment.
176,Sander van Kan,Economy Class,LHR-DEN,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,Flight BA935 DUS-LHR on 31/5/2014 onboard G-EUPU (A319). Flight was on time and smooth. A drink was served together with a small sandwich. Crew was good and the seats were also fine for this short flight.
177,Sander van Kan,Economy Class,ORD-LHR,Solo Leisure,June 2015,False,Flight BA283 LHR-LAX on 31/5/2014 onboard G-XLEE (A380). Flight was punctual and very smooth. A nice breakfast and dinner was served during this flight. We also received an ice cream which was very tasty. Crew was good and friendly. Only drawback are the very few drink rounds that were made during this 11 hour flight. We were seated on the upper deck on row 74. A very big advantage is that the seating is in a 2-4-2 configuration and the window seats have a very nice 'bin' were you can put all your stuff.
178,Prasad Chalikonda,Economy Class,LHR-GLA,Solo Leisure,May 2015,True,Round-trip with family from JFK to HYD via LHR. Onward flight was delayed at JFK by 2 hrs. Was stressful with 10 month old and a 4 yr old. Inflight service was good. Transit at LHR was a nightmare! Mile long walk after alighting to central point in Terminal 5. No gate information anywhere. Had to check-in again they had to scan each and every food item for the baby! Though departing flight was from same Terminal 5 had to now walk 30-40 yards go down a level walk again to train get off second stop go up escalator again and walk another 50 yards to last gate - C63. Now here the gate agent wouldn't let our carry on through. Said it was too big. So had to remove all baby food and items for the kids and carry them in our hands inside the plane and check the carry-on. Return flight again was delayed. Had checked in at 3.30am for 6.40am flight but flight took off at 9.15am. Transit at LHR was thankfully better this time. But the aircraft to JFK was an old 747 - falling apart. No bulkhead this time as original flight was late and they had to accommodate us on another full flight. Old seats kept reclining on its own. A/C was blowing hot and cold until takeoff. Had asked staff to serve meals first to the 4 yr old - no luck. Never going to fly British again or pass through LHR again!
179,E McKerrell,Economy Class,GLA-LHR,Solo Leisure,September 2015,True,"Flew on a 777-200 from London Heathrow to San Diego worst flight I have taken on British Airways. Being a rather tall person 6'7"" and travelling in economy the person in front of me could not recline his seat due to my legs blocking his recline he complained to the cabin personnel that he could not recline and I was asked to remove my knees so he could recline stating to cabin crew that I would not have a comfortable journey they did not seem to care. When the food was served I could not even put my tray table down so the cabin crew would not serve me a meal stating that the tray must be in the down position to eat a meal. So to tell you the truth I spent the best part of 7 hours of a 11 hour flight in the toilet at least in there I could stretch out my legs. Wrote a letter to British Airways to inform them of my flight haven't heard anything back from them. Just shows you they really care about their passengers."
180,T Patrick,Economy Class,FRA-LHR,Business,September 2015,False,Domestic Edinburgh-Gatwick. Late by 40 mins but that's not unusual. Flight itself lovely clean quiet made up some time. Crew smart and friendly. Only down side was coming off a bridge to a closed gate to then being herded onto a packed bus. Bags came fairly quickly sometimes at LGW it can be a while!
181,C Cutts,Economy Class,Gatwick to Barbados,Couple Leisure,September 2015,False,LHR-BSL-LHR A319's each way check/bag drop atT5 took ages around 40 min. Once checked in lounge and boarding good seat 15c enough time for a coffee and sandwich arrived a little late due to weather. Return similar flight experience same food very full flight bag drop at BSL very quick and very nice lounge. Departed a little late and arrived 20 min late otherwise good experience nice crew in both directions.
182,P Alderson,First Class,Kiev to London,Business,September 2015,False,DME-LHR. B747-400. Used Avios to sample the 'new' First. The check-in area at DME was very congested but I did not have to queue. The lounge had plenty of not very comfortable seats and limited food and beverages. The gate area was more like a holding pen and was much too small for a 747 load. First and Club ended up boarding through a different gate number. Once on board I was shown to my seat and given an explanation about the seat functions. Service from the mature crew was excellent (there were only one other passenger in First). The food was OK but not particularly exciting. The main disappointment was the seat and amount of personal space with only enough room for shoes and a jacket in the wardrobe. Everything else had to go in the overhead locker. There seemed to be too many seats crammed into the cabin. I moved from 1K to 3K as this had a bit more space and privacy than the others. From my experience BA First should be called Club World Plus.
183,Storey John,Business Class,London-Vancouver return,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,Flew LCY to MAD in Business only 3 people in a cabin for 12 no welcome no pre take off drinks very poor service awful food warm drinks turbulence as we got in the air dealt with very well. Overall very poor service.
184,Mark Freyton,Economy Class,LHR-ORD,Business,August 2015,False,"Got a wonderful cheap fare from London City to Florence £56 each way! London City a delight to travel through except when your flight is badly delayed which sadly ours was. No announcements made to tell anyone what was happening 2 hour delay shown on the departure board popped up at boarding time. Actually a BA fan but this was handled very badly. No information or assistance. Then when we boarded we were delayed by another hour thankfully once on board the cabin crew and pilots were great at communicating and almost made up for the bad handling by ground staff. Great hot breakfast and drinks served on board on the way out. The return flight was on time and again a lovely crew and a very acceptable snack and drink service. Excellent value compared to the ""low cost"" carriers no extra charges for bags etc allowed and free drinks if you wanted them. Apart from the delay outbound a wonderful trip. Would have been a 10/10 had we left on time."
185,H Sueess,Premium Economy,BOM-LHR,Business,September 2015,False,We had a flight from ZRH to SFO via LHR. The leg from ZRH to LHR on a regular A320 nothing special. The leg from LHR to SFO was on a 747-400 (G-CIVY) was very good. Aircraft was clean and in a good condition. Entertainment was not perfect but sufficient. Food and service very good - Beef was delicious. Staff were very friendly and helpful with our Kids. Flight itself was very calm perfect flight for all of us.
186,H Sueess,Premium Economy,LHR-BOM,Business,August 2015,False,We had a flight from LAX to ZHR via LHR. The leg from LAX to LHR was on a A380-800 (G-XLEA) was very good. Aircraft was clean and in perfect condition. We had bulkhead seats for whole family - perfect (be Aware: Bulkhead seats were very cold because of A/C). Flight was full and leaving on time and boarding was stress less. Entertainment was very good - Touchscreen is a little bit slow but selection is huge. Food and service very good - Beef was delicious. Staff very friendly and helpful with our kids. The leg from LHR to ZRH was on a regular A320 nothing special.
187,Anil Sinanan,Business Class,LHR to BKK,Business,September 2015,False,14/7/14 Trinidad-St Lucia-LGW Club. On the way down from St Lucia BA has an inexplicable outdated crew change. They are the ones from the previous days flight having a two day holiday in St Lucia. Check in at POS is usually unprofessional trini-style. BA shares a lounge which has a colonial style dress code so I had to nip to the loo to change from my shorts to trousers left on time for the 45min trip to St Lucia where the bulk of holidaymakers board back to LGW. I was positive as I heard the new POS-St Lucia cabin crew ask each other if they wanted a beer! They then landed in St Lucia and were busy saying goodbye to each other and the incoming new crew but not saying goodbye to the departing POS-St Lucia passengers! St Lucia-LGW with new crew. Girl came around with newspapers and I said 'FT' please which she had in her hand but she had no clue what the FT was! Did not dare ask for top up to the one glass of bubbly as it is clear as soon as the various jobs are done by various designated crew that's it. New male wash bag is a laugh so I asked for the female wash bag which actually is slightly better. Flight got very cold and I asked for an extra blanket. Told politely but firmly 'sorry' yet there were loads in overhead lockers which I found later. The point about most BA flights these days is to expect nothing and when u get the odd staff member who actually does that extra to consider it as a bonus.
188,Storey John,Business Class,London to Tokyo,Family Leisure,September 2015,True,MAD to LCY Business. Great lounge at Madrid flight boarding very good food awful service poor arrival at LCY good however baggage awful all bags through but mine priority last off!
189,Luis Starr,Economy Class,Vancouver to Milan via LHR,Solo Leisure,April 2015,False,DOH-BAH-LHR-LAX flight started from Doha with a short hop to Bahrain to pick up more passengers. Check in was ok but was over baggage allowance by 1 kilo so made me pay. Flight departed on time with an older 777 with broken AC so everyone was roasting inside the plane not good in a very hot middle eastern summer told it would be better once airborne - had to endure twice due to stop over in Bahrain. Crew were fantastic though very welcoming the moment I stepped onboard compensated the lack of AC. Dinner was served and it was good nothing to write home about as was breakfast. IFE old with no AVOD capabilities so movies are on the loop and few channels with old movies. Arrived at LHR terminal 3 - nice very quite very early in the morning so few people and shops around. Flight to LAX again on an older 777 but new IFE with AVOD this time crew mixed bag male crew a bit rude. Food - lunch was ok like the dessert but small portions bring lots of food and 2 hours before arrival a sad sandwich and yoghurt was serve other carriers serve full meal as second meal or snack and around that time IFE crashed on half the plane nothing to do about it good thing it was almost arrival time pretty boring flight and full as well arrived on time and bags were out in 10 minutes that is if you can come out of immigration faster. It was an ok long flight very disappointing but it did get me where I wanted to be.
190,S Tibble,Economy Class,GIG to LHR,Couple Leisure,March 2015,False,10th July BA117 LHR-JFK. Well I have not flown with BA for a number of years as they are not my favourite airline from past experience. We were travelling with hand luggage so should be easy. Decided to not pre purchase seats but go for online check in and seat selection. All very easy and got good seats on 777-300 should have been 747 but obviously had an aircraft change. So we arrive at airport and go to security and scan our boarding cards get rejected you need to get your passport and visa validated from the BA desk before you can proceed. Would be good if this was shown on boarding pass. Boarding very good onto a new plane good seats good entertainment staff seemed interested and engaging. All the crew seemed very good. I walked off the aircraft with my view of BA restored would I fly again with them yes.
191,Hannah Shad,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Venice,Solo Leisure,September 2015,False,Flew GOT-LHR-LAX and back on the new A380. Flight from GOT-LHR was alright even though the flatbread they served was inedible. Transferred through T5 quick and easy. Must say that Heathrow gets better and better for every time you visit! The long haul flight on BA's A380 was excellent. I was sat on the upper deck which is a huge privilege since the seats are 2-4-2 also I was sat in a window seat which made it all even better since they've installed lockers next to the seats where you can put your stuff. The staff was excellent (and also very good looking) and the food was better than I could've imagined for an economy route. The whole experience was overall better than I'd thought for a 500$ ticket and so far the best I've gone with when it comes to flights over the Atlantic.
192,D Day,Business Class,London to Paris,Family Leisure,September 2015,True,"LGW-BGI-LGW Club World R/T. Old careworn B777-200. Airplane was not clean both sectors. Food outbound from Gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices. Inbound airplane toilets reeked. At least food on return was slightly improved. Cabin Crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed / robotic. The Club World seats are narrow and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. Screens poor and tiny selection of movies. BA's so called Business Class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. I am amazed that British Airways standards are so low and they get away with it. This is mere A to B transport. What is missing from their Business Class is ""class""."
193,Senden Roswitha,Economy Class,Heathrow to Bangkok,Solo Leisure,August 2015,True,"Very disappointed with my flight back from Munich although it's only 2 hours all that was offered was a small basket consisting of a packet of nuts or shortbread. The flight over to Munich was considerably better being offered chicken curry wrap etc. We were told when booking this return in Munich that there was only one seat left however once in the aircraft there were still seats left including one next to me! However it's really the snack offered that's my main ""bone of contention"" as we chose British Airway in preference to the cheap budget airlines but we now find there's little difference in the on flight catering."
194,Jackie Craig,Economy Class,Las Vegas to London Heathrow,Solo Leisure,August 2015,True,I flew with British Airways with my mother from Paphos to Manchester. She had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. I was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. Then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! I think this is total disregard for passenger welfare. I will never fly with BA again.
195,J Norman,Business Class,Athens to London,Couple Leisure,August 2015,True,Flew LHR to Mumbai return with my husband - very disappointing. The Galleries lounge at Terminal 5 was overcrowded noisy and had the feel of a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by BA. The food was below average. Unable to avail ourselves of the spa' facilities as they were fully booked. Not enough toilets for the number of people in the lounge and my husband had to queue! We had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of £240. When we boarded the aircraft (Boeing 747-400) the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. The 'yin and yang' seat configuration didn't work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. The seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. My IFE did not work on the return flight. The in-flight food was above average but not outstanding. Check-in at Mumbai for the return flight was very slow. We were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. No facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. The whole experience of BA's Club World was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again.
196,Payne Rob,Business Class,JFK to Manchester via LHR,Family Leisure,August 2015,False,LHR-CPH-LHR. Business class on the way out and economy on the return trip. Flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes. No inflight entertainment at all both operated by A320's whose seats were looking just a little tired. The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.
197,D Leston,Economy Class,Gatwick to Barcelona,Business,September 2015,False,LHR-FRA-LHR in spotlessly clean airbuses both looked brand new (although they weren't). Crews were immensely friendly and helpful with a smile for everybody. Slight delay on the return leg but kept well informed. Only minus point is the remote stands at FRA that slow boarding and disembarkation to a snails pace.
198,G Thompson,Premium Economy,MAN to BOM via LHR,Solo Leisure,September 2015,False,Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.
199,Harris Lisa,Premium Economy,Rome to London,Couple Leisure,August 2015,False,Just taken a BA flight LHR-JFK rtn. Outstanding service staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable. The cabin director found out it was my Dad's 60th birthday and gave him a bottle of champagne to take away. Very friendly and nothing too much trouble. We flew on older 747 and newer 777 with latest interior - both very comfortable plenty of leg room and entertainment great. Screen on older aircraft a little small but much better on newer. Food was the best I had on any airline. Restaurant quality without a doubt.
